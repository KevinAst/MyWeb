<center><h1>Review of Literature</h1></center>


The exhibitor learned much about software development using an
object-oriented language.<p>

<i>"An object is a software bundle of related variables and
methods. Software objects are often used to model real-world objects
you find in everyday life."</i>
<a href="reference.html#campione">(Campione, 2000)</a>.
In the exhibitor's project, the main software objects are
computer-simulated mice.<p>

<i>"Software objects interact and communicate with each other using
messages."</i>
<a href="reference.html#campione">(Campione, 2000)</a>.
Each <b>Mouse</b> defines it's own <b><i>makeAMove</i></b> method
which returns a direction to move in a maze.  The maze-solving engine
calls this method.  There are several methods that are used by the
<b>Mouse</b>.  For example, <i><b>passagewayOpenAt</i></b> to see if a
direction is open, and <i><b>distanceToGoal</i></b> that returns the
distance to the maze end.<p>

<i>"Inheritance is a mechanism whereby one class of objects can be
defined as a special case of a more general class, automatically
including the method and variable definitions of the general class."</i>
<a href="reference.html#taylor">(Taylor, 1993, p. 16)</a>.
In the exhibitor's case, all of the mice inherit from the base class
<b>Mouse</b>.<p>


The <i><b>makeAMove</i></b> method is defined at the base class
<b>Mouse</b> level.  Each <b>Mouse</b> type defines it's own
<i><b>makeAMove</i></b> method with it's own strategy.  Subclasses
<i>"can define a method that has exactly the same method
signature (arguments and return type) as a method in its superclass.
In that case, the method in the subclass overrides the method in the
superclass and effectively replaces its implementation.  Overriding
methods to change the behavior of objects is another form of
polymorphism: the one most people think of when they talk about the
power of object-oriented languages."</i>
<a href="reference.html#niemeyer">(Niemeyer, 1996, p. 134)</a>.
Because of this, the maze-solving engine (written by the exhibitor's
Father) knows how to interact with all objects, because they are all a
type of <b>Mouse</b>, and have a <i><b>makeAMove</i></b> method.<p>

<b>Smarty</b> is a special type of <b>Mouse</b> that has a brain.  It
remembers where it has been.  Therefore all derivations of
<b>Smarty</b> have a brain too, just because they are derived from
<b>Smarty</b>.<p>

The exhibitor also learned several facts about mazes.  There are
many different kinds of mazes.  Two parts that were studied are
dimension and routing.<p>

<ul>

<li><b>Dimension</b>: <i>"The dimension class is basically how many dimensions in
space the Maze covers."</i>
<a href="reference.html#pullen">(Pullen, 1999)</a>.
An example of this is 2D or 3D.<p>

<li><b>Routing</b>: <i>"The routing class refers to the types of passages"</i>
<a href="reference.html#pullen">(Pullen, 1999)</a>.
<p>

</ul>

The exhibitor's project uses a maze that is two dimensional, with a
perfect routing class.  <i>"A perfect Maze means one without any loops or
closed circuits, and without any inaccessible areas".</i>
<a href="reference.html#pullen">(Pullen, 1999)</a>.
A perfect maze only has one solution.<p>
