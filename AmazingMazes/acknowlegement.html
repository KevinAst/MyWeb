<center><h1>Acknowledgments</h1></center>

I would like to thank my Dad for writing the Maze Solving engine.  He
also taught me about objects and Java.  He also helped me analyze the
data, and taught me how to use Visio to draw my diagrams.  He also
converted my report to the Internet.<p>
  
I would like to thank Mr. Bob Kirkland
(<a target="_top" href="http://www.mazeworks.com">http://www.mazeworks.com</a>)
for letting me use his MazeGen program for generating mazes.<p>

I would like to thank my Mother for helping with the display board.<p>
