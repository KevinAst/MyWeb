      If time permits, I will post some videos of the app :-)

<li>Below each Maze you can select the Mouse to run the puzzle.  Be
careful with ScatterBrained ... he is not too smart, and may take a
long time to solve.

<li>The text box shows the results of each run (with an astrisk next to
the winner)!

<li>Each puzzle cycle will generate a new random maze and then make a
duplicate copy for each Mouse to traverse.  It is then up to each
Mouse to solve the puzzle!  Starting gates are at the green square,
and the finish line is in red.  False moves are shown in gray, and the
solution is highlighted in yellow.  Since this is a perfect maze, each
puzzle has only one solution.
  
<li>You may select the Maze Size, vary the Solve Speed, and put it in a
continous Cycle mode.
