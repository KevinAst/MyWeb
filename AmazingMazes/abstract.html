<b>Purpose:</b><br>
What strategy can a computer-simulated mouse use to solve a maze the
fastest (using the fewest number of moves)?  I think that a
computer-simulated mouse that uses a random pattern will be able to
solve the maze in the fewest numbers of moves.<p>

<b>Procedure:</b><br>
<ol>

<li>Program several mice with different maze solving strategies.<p>

<li>Run several tests to tell which mouse can solve a maze the fastest
(using the fewest number of moves).  For each test, all the mice will
solve the same maze.  A lot of tests will be run with different mazes.<p>

<li>Summarize the data. This step will have a lot of data to average
since the computer can run many tests.  Chart and average the data.
Determine if there is a clear trend, or pattern.<p>

</ol>

<b>Conclusion:</b><br>
The exhibitor's hypothesis was wrong.  Goaly(the mouse that will
always go in the open direction that is nearest to the end of the
maze) was the winner by far.  All the other strategies were worse.<p>
