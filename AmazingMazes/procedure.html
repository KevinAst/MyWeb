<h2><a href="#TOP"> <img border=0 src="images/bulletUp.gif"></a> Methods </h2>

<ol>
  <li><b>Program the Mice</b><br>

This step involves creating different mice with different strategies
that we will use to compare (see <a href="software.html#mouseClass">Appendix A</a>).<p>
      
<i>The mice that we plan to create are:</i><br>
<ul>

<li><b><i>ScatterBrained</i></b> - ScatterBrained doesn't have a memory and goes
through the maze in any random open direction.
    
<li><b><i>Randy</i></b> - Like ScatterBrained, Randy goes through the maze in any
random open direction.  Unlike ScatterBrained, Randy has a memory.
    
<li><b><i>NESW</i></b> - NESW goes North, East, South or West in that order, which
ever one is first open. He also has a memory.
    
<li><b><i>SWEN</i></b> - SWEN goes South, West, East, or North in that order, which
ever one is first open. He also has a memory.
    
<li><b><i>FocusedR</i></b> - FocusedR always tries to go straight.  If he can't go
straight, then he turns right until an opening is found.  He also has
a memory.
    
<li><b><i>FocusedL</i></b> - FocusedL always tries to go straight.  If he can't go
straight, then he turns left until an opening is found.  He also has a
memory.
    
<li><b><i>Goalie</i></b> - Goalie will always go in the open direction that is
nearest to the end of the maze.  He also has a memory.
    
</ul><p>


<i>For each mouse that is to be created:</i><br>
<ol type="a">

<li>Derive the mouse from the appropriate mouse parent.
    
<li>Program the makeAMove method.  This method will implement a
specific strategy, returning a move direction of
North/East/South/West/Retreat for each move
(see <a href="source.html">Appendix B</a>).<p>
    
<li>Add the mouse to the maze engine software.  This will allow us to
select this new mouse in our tests.
    
<li>Compile all source code using the Java compiler.  Fix any compiler
errors.
    
<li>Run a test of this new mouse (in slow motion) to see if it's
strategy is programmed correctly.
    
</ol><p>

  <li><b>Run the tests</b><br>

This step will run several tests to tell which mouse can solve a
maze the fastest (using the fewest number of moves).  For each test,
all the mice will solve the same maze.  A lot of tests will be run
with different mazes.<p>

<i>For each test, do the following:</i><br>
<ol type="a">
<li>Run MazeGen program using this command: java MazeGen
    
<li>In the pulldown menus under each maze, select the mouse that is to
run the maze.
    
<li>Select the maze size to test.
    
<li>Click the cycle button to start the test.  This runs many tests
with different mazes.
    
<li>Let the program run over night, running up to 5000 tests,
collecting the data in a file.

</ol>
    
<i>Repeat the steps above for different size mazes.</i><p>

  <li><b>Summarize the data</b><br>

This step will have a lot of data to average since the computer can
run many tests.
<ol type="a">

<li>Chart and average the data.
    
<li>Determine if there is a clear trend, or pattern.
    
</ol>

</ul>
