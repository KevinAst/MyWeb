<center><h1>Conclusion</h1></center>

The exhibitor's hypothesis was wrong.  <b>Goaly</b> (the mouse that
will always go in the open direction that is nearest to the end of the
maze) was the winner.  All the other strategies were worse.<p>

<h1>Project Variations</h1>

Several things could change the results of this project.<p>

If the exhibitor had more time he could try a more complex type of
maze (other than a "perfect" maze), or a maze that has cells with more
than four walls.<p>

The mice used have total recall (they remember every place they have
been).  If the exhibitor had more time he could build mice that would
only remember so many past steps. <p>
