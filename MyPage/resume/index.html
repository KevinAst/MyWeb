My most recent activity has been with RGA-TP (Reinsurance Group of
America - Technology Partners). RGA-TP markets a commercial J2EE
application to insurance companies - world wide. AURA (Automated
Underwriting and Risk Analysis) provides a suite of products that
facilitate the automation of the underwriting process. Notable
components that comprise AURA are:<p>

<ul>

<li>
A Rules Engine that maintains client-configurable underwriting rules
to determine risk and eligibility status of insureds - based on a
question/answer session.<p>

<li>
An Underwriting Workbench that provides clients with the ability to
consolidate and track case details, such as: outstanding requirements,
outstanding work items, notes, final decisions, reinsurance details,
and manual decisions.<p>

</ul>


I have been instrumental in developing a number of major system
enhancements, including the following:<p>

<ul>

<li>AURA Web Service<p>

This effort provided a programmatic interface to the AURA session,
representing the first interactive Aura offering that does not promote
a GUI representation - rather program-to-program API (bound through a
web-service). This component is used by clientele that wish to take
complete control of their GUI, and simply use Aura as a "back-end
service".<p>

An extensive design effort was accomplished to promote a very
object-oriented model of the legacy rule engine.<p>

<li>Decision and Risk Assessment<p>

This component provides the mechanism by which underwriting decisions
can be formulated by assessing risks analyzed from multiple sources --
both automated (AURA scripts), and manually entered decisions (by a
human underwriter). This provides a "Clearing House" where by multiple
information sources can be controlled, summarized, and maintained --
in a holistic way.<p>

<li>Aura's Web 2.0 compliant AJAX-based User Interface (Ui2)<p>

Ui2 is Aura's next generation script GUI - promoting Aura's dynamic
reflexive question/answer session.  Internally, Ui2 is layered on top
of Aura's WebService.  The object-oriented nature of this API provides
a very clean model to build upon.<p>

The GUI was completely re-vamped using a modern up-to-date look and
feel.  User inputs are specified through a more intuitive "form entry"
style, with fill-in-the-blank semantics.<p>

The philosophy of this GUI is to maintain the User's current state,
whenever a service request is implicitly required, providing a very
intuitive "user experience", even when Aura's sub-reflexive structure
dynamically injects a sub-question mid-stream.  This provides the best
of both worlds - the power of Aura's dynamic reflexive structure, with
an intuitive GUI presentation.<p>

Question types were enhanced to promote more-streamlined entry.
Examples of this include the date calendar popups, auto-complete
impairment search, streamlined contacts, implicit treatment of
optional questions, advanced treatment of question notes and help,
non-intrusive spell-check popups, etc.<p>

Higher level presentation directives were made available.  For
example, the new grid directive supports a concise rendering of
repeated disclosures within a grid (via Aura's wrapup).<p>

Ui2 is Web 2.0 compliment.  This means that it does NOT take control
of the entire browser window.  As a result, an Aura Script can be
embedded within the larger context of the client's application page
(say through a sub-section of the page, or even a Dhtml popup).<p>

A hallmark of Ui2 is to provide modular extension points that support
customization at either a deployment or customer level.  This
"extension" philosophy applies to both style (CSS) and logic
(JavaScript).  This is accomplished without functionally modifying
core, allowing the customization points to more easily migrate to
subsequent Aura releases.<p>

<li>ATF (Aura Testing Framework)<p>

I designed and implemented an advanced testing tool used by AURA users
to validate their rules.  This utility is a "System Testing" tool, as
it exercises fully deployed AURA functionality.  An innovative
approach was used where test data (both complex input and expected
results) could be maintained in spreadsheets, interactively driving
the test suite (through internal macros).<p>

<li>Aura's Next Generation Disclosure Engine (DE)<p>

The last achievement of my RGA tenure was part of a team that re-wrote
RGA's long standing AURA rules engine.  A new design was implemented
that promoted a next-generation Disclosure Engine.  I was instrumental
in the design process, and lead the team that developed the Disclosure
Engine User Interface - using the Angular 1 framework (very new at
the time).<p>

<li>Various additional Aura components were architected, including:<p>

<ul>
<li>Underwriting Work Queue
<li>MIB Code Reporter
<li>Correspondence Send Processor
<li>Multi-Lingual Refactor
</ul><p>

This position was a collaboration with Q-up Mobile Systems (a local
startup company) to develop a series of mobile applications.  This
work occurred in the midst of my RGA work (see above).<p>

While somewhat confidential (at this point), the apps were based on a
J2ME architecture (Java Micro Edition), and were deployed to
GPS-enabled cell phones and PDAs.<p>

One aspect of this project involved the development of a sophisticated
web-based geographical mapping agent, utilizing the Google Maps API (a
programmatic API that provides the ability to interject
application-specific graphical overlays), employing an AJAX-based Web
2.0 architecture.<p>

This position was with the Monsanto TCC Group (Technology
Computing Consortium), enhancing the biotech systems used by their
genomic molecular breeding scientists.  The applications are Java
based, and utilize a variety of component architectures, including:
Corba, Servlets, Struts, Swing, Applets, and Java2D.  The development
team utilizes an Agile-XP process, and employees test-first design
principles.<p>

I was instrumental in re-factoring the underlying architecture to
utilize business-objects, capable of being marshaled over a
distributed boundary (through XML).<p>

I designed and implemented a full-featured scheduling system,
supporting the automation of project work within the lab.  The system
is very interactive, promoting a variety of flexible views, with
drag-and-drop capabilities.<p>

I also architected a report query tool using an XML grammar.  The XML
binding provided an expressive mechanism to represent complex and
extensive structures in an intuitive way.  All queries were maintained
by our administrative users, and presented through a dynamic menu
hierarchy.<p>

This position started as a short-term project where I was involved in
the rapid development and deployment of the Express Script Alternate
Funding System. Once this was complete I was transitioned into the
groups primary application, called SDS (Specialty Distribution
System).<p>

In addition to my component development responsibilities, I have
promoted extensive use of high-level documentation (in an on-line
web-based form), both technical specifications (using UML class and
sequence diagrams), along with extensive javadoc.  I have also
implemented several automated development processes, including a build
process using ant, and an automated test environment using JUnit.<p>

This system is a high-volume order processing system, that distributes
"special needs" drugs, on behalf of a variety of different drug
suppliers and manufactures.  The system utilizes Corba-based
client/server technology, and is implemented in Java, with an Oracle
data repository.<p>

I joined this project subsequent to it's release in production.  My
primary responsibility has been in the area of re-architecting various
critical-path components -- to provide better throughput, with more
flexibility, using sound Object Oriented design principles.  My major
contributions include the following:<p>

<ul>

<!-- new item within SDS -->
<li><b>Order Release Process</b><br>

    This process was completely re-architected, to accommodate the
    following goals:

    <ol>
    <li>Improve throughput performance, as the transaction volume scaled up
        over 10 times (30,000 to 300,000 orders per month).

    <li>Improve the maintainability of the validation rules, providing an
        Object Oriented solution that addresses both re-usability and
        flexibility (several checks are shared between client suppliers).
    </ol><p>
    
    The end result of this re-design effort was very successful, improving
    throughput performance by a factor of 10, even with the increased volume.
    Equally important was the maintainability improvement of the release
    checks themselves, through an extendable and open architecture.
    The following aspects were implemented:

    <ol type="a">
    <li>Develop and utilize a broad-scoped caching object (SdsObjCache and
      OrderBasedCache) that's life cycle is defined within the context of
      a logical transaction. This significantly reduced the overhead
      associated with redundant database retrievals made throughout the
      code base.
    
    <li>Develop and utilize a common java interface through which ALL
      release checks conform. This provides a consistent API that can
      be reasoned about at an abstract level. Because each rule is defined
      in a consistent manor, the architecture is more expandable in an
      open environment. In addition, because each rule is defined through
      an object binding, it lends itself to being processed in concurrent
      threads.
    
    <li>Rewrote the "expert system" Jess eligibility rules (written in
      clips) into java components, making them consistent with all other
      components in the new architecture. Because of the variability between
      rules across programs, the overhead of launching the rule
      engine process (for each request) was eliminated.
    
    <li>Utilized java threads to concurrently process the various
      release checks that are appropriate for each program. All checks
      occur concurrently, since there is no inter-dependency between
      them. This was implemented using a newly introduced thread pool
      manager, which maintains a free pool of Java Threads, that can be
      re-used over and over again.
    
    <li>Develop and utilize a more formal timing probe instrumentation and
      analysis.
    </ol><p>

<li><b>Enrollment Expert System</b><br>

    A generic Expert System component was developed to support the needs
    of the SDS Enrollment process.  This component has the ability to reason
    about client-supplied knowledge, replacing the Jess component that was used in
    the AltFunding Means Tester.  The SDS Enrollment project
    had several additional requirements (over and above AltFunding) that
    necessitated a re-architecture. These requirements were:

    <ol type="a">
    <li>The ability to Short-Circuit Responses that have no bearing on the
        end result.
    
    <li>The ability to provide Explanations of how the results were produced
        -- specifically for Needs-More-Information, and Denials.
    
    <li>An easier mechanism to establish user-defined constraining rules,
        without the complexity of the low-level / high-level rule
        segregation.

    </ol><p>
    
    It was recognized early on that our previous architecture, modeling
    knowledge through clips rules, would fundamentally not satisfy these
    requirements.  Supporting these advanced features require a
    meta-reasoning capability, that is, the ability to reason about the
    rules themselves. This provides features such as how, why, what if,
    and the ability to identify missing input that could affect resultant
    decisions, etc. Meta-reasoning dictates that the rules themselves be
    treated as data. Fortunately in our case, the rules could be
    represented as a network of and/or nodes and both the reasoning and
    meta-reasoning functionality needed can be accomplished using rather
    strait forward algorithms -- using any conventional language (such as
    Java).  The decision to replace the Jess component was a straightforward
    for the following reasons:

    <ol>
    <li>Comparable development effort 
    <li>Concurrency -- no longer restricted to a single threaded model (we
        can evaluate multiple concurrent requests)
    <li>Licensing issue resolved -- Jess license is no longer needed 
    <li>More flexible in tailoring exact desired results 
    <li>Faster performance
    <li>Less resource utilization (both memory footprint and throughput)
    <li>No longer need to maintain Jess skills in the group
    </ol><p>

    
<!-- new item within SDS -->
<li><b>Correspondence</b><br>

    Re-factored the SDS Correspondence sub-system.  This component was
    unique in that it is never directly interacted with, rather
    correspondence is generated as a result of select "secondary"
    external activities.  As an example, when an order is completed - one
    type of correspondence is generated, or when an enrollment is made -
    another type of correspondence is sent.<p>
    
    A delegation event model was employed, providing the proper
    division of work.  A "secondary" external activity emits the
    appropriate application-defined events, while suitable correspondence
    agents listen for selected events, generating the necessary
    correspondence.<p>
    
    The correspondence listeners were implemented through a supplier-based
    class hierarchy (using a factory pattern), which allowed
    supplier-specific correspondence decisions to be applied at the
    appropriate location (using polymorphism).<p>
    
    With the introduction of this event/listener model, it was crucial to
    retrofit all logic to utilize this central point of control.  Prior to
    this effort, logic was spread out over a variety of places (as a
    result it was unwieldy, difficult to maintain, and not very
    expandable).<p>

    
<!-- new item within SDS -->
<li><b>Reporting Architecture</b><br>

    A reporting architecture was developed that is both open and
    extendable.  Some of the key highlights of the architecture were:<br>

    <ol type="a">
    <li>Supports both Corba-based client/server requests, and unix command
      line requests.
    
    <li>Supports an unlimited number of report formats, that are
      selectable at run-time (for example: text, html, xml, csv, etc.).
    
    <li>The XML is open ... in that it is not required to conform to a
      global set of characteristics defined for all reports. While common
      XML characteristics are in fact defined (and used) by infrastructure
      components, a report can still characterize XML to it's specific
      need.
    
    <li>The report rendering factory utilizes reflection, allowing the
      repertoire of reports to be expanded without modification to the
      underlying factory implementation (a key design principle of a well
      designed system).
    
    <li>The architecture is open, utilizing interface based contractual
      agreements. As an example, the utilization of the velocity template
      engine is optional ... it is available, but can be bypassed.
    </ol><p>
    
<!-- new item within SDS -->
<li><b>Object Cache</b><br>

    A general-purpose SDS object cache was developed that had knowledge of
    all SDS object types.  SdsObjCache objects serve as a clearing house
    for access to all SDS structures.  Each accessor employs a lazy
    initialization pattern, meaning that the overhead of initialization is
    only incurred if the data is requested.<p>
    
    The cache duration is completely defined by the client's usage, tied
    to the life-cycle of each SdsObjCache.  A typical usage scenario would
    be to use a cache instance only within the context of a logical
    transaction.  This allows each transaction to see the most current
    database content while significantly reducing the number of redundant
    database accesses within the scope of the transaction.<p>
    
    SdsObjCache is re-usable and generic in the sense that it can be used
    by any SDS component.  Derivations of SdsObjCache can provide
    value-added semantics to a specific component/operation (for example,
    a multi-threaded initialization process, seeded with key contextual
    information).<p>
    
    SdsObjCache is thread safe.  It guarantees that requests for the same
    object key will return the same object instance (even in a
    multi-threaded environment).  In addition, parallel processing will
    function in the most optimal fashion, synchronizing on the smallest
    scope locking objects possible.  This promotes the most optimal
    throughput possible.<p>
    
<!-- new item within SDS -->
<li><b>SysResources</b><br>
    
    The configuration of the entire SDS system was re-architected to
    utilize a central SysResources class.  In essence this class fronts a
    series of java properties.  However, much more value is provided by
    abstracting several complexities in regard to loading properties,
    initializing sub-systems, and accessing higher level resources.<p>
    
    The SDS System run-time configuration is accomplished through a single
    java property file. Multiple property files can be used, but in
    general, are not needed.  The details of this configuration have been
    abstracted through the use of the SysResources java component.  It is
    possible to utilize a single (unmodified) property file for all
    processes in all deployment environments.
    As a result, this single resource can be version
    controlled, and deployed as part of the packaging process of the build
    procedure.<p>
    
    
<!-- new item within SDS -->
<li><b>ThreadPool</b><br>

    Developed a Java thread pool utility, maintaining a free pool of Java
    Threads, that can be re-used over and over again, eliminating the
    expensive overhead of thread startup.<p>
    
    The pool is created with an initial capacity of Threads. The number of
    threads can dynamically increase beyond the initial capacity, as
    required ... based on the maximum number of concurrent threads
    requested.<p>

This system provides a customizable means test, matching patients with
a variety of third party programs that offer prescription drug
financial assistance.  The system is a client/server web-based portal,
utilizing Java, Corba, and Oracle.  It also employs an expert system
component, using Jess ...  a Java based Clips derivative.<p>

I was responsible for the design and implementation of the back-end
distributed Corba Java components, along with the expert system means
testing service.<p>

A typical usage scenario would be an iterative process where an
advocate answers a series questions about a patient.  At any time a
means test can be performed to determine what assistance programs they
are qualified for.  If a program's eligibility cannot be determined
because additional information is required, those unanswered questions
are then presented.<p>

The acceptance criteria, for the various third party assistance
programs, can be completely customized by an application
administrator.  This criteria persists within an Oracle relational
database.  The means testing component utilizes an expert system
knowledge base, which is derived from the Oracle representation,
transformed into a Jess Clips format.<p>

I was part of a team that developed AG Edwards' On-Line Investing
(OLI) system.  This is a web-based application providing customer
access to on-line trading.  This is one of the first customer-based
global internet applications at AG Edwards.  The architecture is J2EE
compliant, employing Java Servlets, Enterprise Java Beans (EJB), and
XML, deployed under WebLogic 5.1.<p>

A strong emphasis was placed on architecture, design, and
documentation.  Standards, utilities, and procedures were established
that work in an open environment (spanning the gambit from NT
development workstations, to the production delivery Unix platforms).<p>

My responsibilities included a full gamut of the various architectural
tiers, including servlet components, internationalization, view state,
state transition, business services (utilizing session EJBs), and the
business domain objects (used throughout each layer of the various
software tiers).  I was also responsible for the design/implementation
of various infrastructure components, key to the architecture, along
with the development/build environment, and documentation standards
used by the entire team.<p>

<ul>

<li>Served as a mentor in both Java and OO technologies.

<li>Established coding/documentation standards, and performed code
   reviews.

<li>Analyzed/Isolated/Corrected a major memory leak problem, related to
   application thread usage within an EJB environment.

<li>Implemented a systematic testing strategy, utilizing JUnit.  This
   was incorporated into our build utility, enhancing ease-of-use, and
   providing seamless integration into our nightly build process.

<li>Developed the internationalization architectural components used
   within the application.  This was based on Java's standard
   ResourseBundle, and is utilized for both internationalized display
   text, and user messages.

<li>Developed a base adapter architecture, encapsulating the common
   characteristics of interfacing to enterprise level back-end
   systems.  The protocol used in these systems was based on XML.

<li>Developed a simulation service architecture that was utilized prior
   to real service availability, and continues to be used during
   back-end outages.  This utility is configurable at run-time, and
   integrated at a low-level infrastructure component, meaning that
   all application code is exercised, and application logic is unaware
   of the simulation status (in other words, no conditional logic is
   required at the application level).

<li>Developed a service "HeartBeat" architecture, which can relay
   statistics on any service bean (configurable through a run-time
   resource).  The major items of interest were 1) the TUX domain
   names (which define the service location), 2) whether the back-end
   is simulated or live, and 3) a real-time "ping" status (identifying
   if the back-end service is alive or dead).  Detailed information is
   cataloged in regard to the "ping" request.  This service is
   visualized in a summary on-line table format, that is accessible
   through a status servlet.

<li>Maintained application domain object oversight.  Developed
   architectural infrastructure in regard to domain objects.

<li>Primary party responsible for the integration effort from the
   order-handler service bean (session EJB) to the back-end
   order-processing service.

<li>Developed several XML parsing utilities, including a SAX Router,
   which provided finer grained "delegation" event handling (over and
   above the standard SAX protocol).

<li>Developed a Java thread pool utility with a virtual ThreadHandle,
   allowing client logic to interact with a "logical thread".

<li>Developed a comprehensive application enablements utility.  This
   architecture consolidates all authorization policy rules in a
   single control point, acting as a clearing house of application
   specific "Can I Do This" questions.  Enablement methods build on
   one another, providing a comprehensive set of dependency rules,
   improving integrity, simplifying usage patterns, and enhancing
   maintainability.  All underlying distributed security data access
   was optimized, using threads where necessary, and cached over the
   course of a transaction (eliminating redundant and expensive
   distributed calls).

<li>Developed utilities to support application monitor probes,
   gathering a variety of statistical information, including
   performance, timing, request/response sizes, memory utilization,
   load balancing, network performance, etc.

<li>Developed an external navigation utility, retaining state of any
   un-processed request, allowing it to be resumed when user
   re-enters.

<li>Developed a diagnostic logging tool (Diag) that is used heavily in
   all of our production code.

   <ul>
   <li>This utility provides a flexible mechanism by which diagnostic
     probes can be conditionally logged through a filtering
     mechanism. Messages are tagged to specific severity levels (such
     as debugging, warning, error, etc.), and filtered appropriately
     at run-time.

   <li>A very flexible and efficient filtering mechanism is utilized
     which supports a fine grained tuning of only the probes of
     interest.

   <li>Diag is highly optimized, so that when a message is filtered out,
     virtually no run-time overhead is incurred.  This means that
     diagnostic probes can be left untouched, even for production
     runs, by simply allowing the filter to default to a production
     level.
     
   </ul>

<li>Developed a Jolt Session Pool Manager, which was a thin wrapper
   around BEA's SessionPoolManager.  The primary value of this utility
   is related to run-time configuration.

<li>Developed a generic translator utility class that maintains a
   bi-directional mapping, allowing objects of one domain to be
   translated to objects of a different domain, and vice versa.

<li>Developed run-time configuration ability, using a property-based
   configuration utility.

<li>Developed a generic error representation scheme, based on a
   symbolic federated namespace.  Notice collections were utilized to
   support compound error notification to the end-user.  A generic
   search/filter ability was built into this utility.

<li>Developed a technique where all enumerated states for a specific
   application context are encapsulated in a light-weight Java class.
   This is similar to C/C++ enumerations.  Each choice class is
   machine-generated, from an XML source, using XSLT.  This practice
   incorporates the following benefits:

   <ul>

   <li>They are type-safe, defining a complete set of options ... no
     more, no less.

   <li>They are self-documenting.

   <li>These classes easily support expansion to additional choices in
     the future.

   <li>Support is automatically provided for both Invalid and Undefined
     scenarios.

   <li>Aliasing is also supported, allowing multiple symbolic names to
     reference the same Choice.
    
   </ul>

My position at Edward Jones, involved an extensive effort to convert
their legacy mainframe systems to a client/server architecture.  The
initial conversion effort utilized C++, in a UNIX X-Windows Motif
environment, with a distributed ORACLE database at multiple branch
satellites.<p>
 
Subsequent projects were web-based implementations, utilizing Java
Applets/Servlets, and JavaScript. A business tier middle-ware
component was employed (implemented in Java).<p>

Several early prototypes were developed in CGI using Perl.<p>

One of my project efforts also employed Java JNI (Java Native
Interface) tying into legacy libraries, and utilized Java RMI (Remote
Method Invocation) as a distributed service protocol.<p>

An on-line documentation approach was developed that included both
project content (such as Architecture, Design, Object Models, and
Technical Specification) as well as process (such as methodologies
used, and administrative procedures).<p>

I have also been utilized at Jones in establishing their internal
standards and tool selection, specifically in the area of Java and C++

During this assignment a proof-of-concept prototype was developed which promoted
the benefits of combining Object Oriented Technology with Distributed Object
Management in the deployment of Network Management Applications.  My
responsibility entailed the deployment of an architecture that externally
promoted a distributed API, while internally interfacing to the OSI Network
Manager.  The distributed aspect of the project was based on the OMG's (Object
Management Group) CORBA specification (Common Object Request Broker
Architecture).  The project was implemented using C++ and Orbix as the CORBA
compliant ORB (Object Request Broker).  An informal evaluation was completed
that compared two CORBA products - XShell from Expersoft, and Orbix from Iona

This assignment involved the development of a hydro-mechanical/electrical design
engineering analysis tool.  The major components of this system include
schematic capture, control law definition, and simulation.  One of the key
aspects that made this project unique was it's ability to model a system's
digital control laws in the form of graphical decision trees that are
executable.  The logic script is highly integrated with the schematic, and is
the driving force behind the simulation.  A full featured symbolic debugger was
implemented to assist in performing logic validation. <p>

The system adheres to a strict object oriented methodology, and was implemented
using C++, Motif, and X-Windows, on both Sun SPARC and HP700 work-stations.
It's user interface is very flexible and highly intuitive, patterned after the
dominant GUI's of today.  The system utilizes pull-down and pop-up menus, and
electronic clipboards.  Mouse wrappers allow graphical objects to be
mouse-selectable.  Overlapping prioritized windows allow multiple concurrent
viewports to display the same or different models in the same or different
formats. <p>

The system actually provides an automated design knowledge capture.  The
acquired design information is to be used in subsequent tools to support
testability, embedded systems software, reliability and maintainability, thereby
promoting concurrent engineering and integrated product definition.  This was a
very exciting project which obtained high level visibility within MDC. <p>

The system is very production oriented.  Even though it was a research project,
it is being actively used in the production design of several sub-systems on the
F/A-18 E/F, T45, and C17 aircraft. <p>
