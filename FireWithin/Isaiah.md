# Isaiah

Isaiah prophesied during a pivotal point in Israel's history. Because
of their sin, God sent Babylon to judge Israel. But Isaiah's ministry
held out hope that God would save them through judgement. Isaiah told
Israel that she needed to trust God more than she trusted false gods
and other kingdoms. Though Israel refused to heed Isaiah's warning,
God still chose to save her. And God saved Israel, not through judging
them, but by the suffering and judgment Jesus experienced on the
cross.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Isaiah Introduction**

> The prophet Isaiah addressed the kingdom of Judah for forty years,
> beginning in the year that King Uzziah died (around 740 BC) and
> continuing at least to the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem in 701 BC. As
> with all the prophets, Isaiah based his message on the deep covenant
> bond between God and his people Israel. Prophets typically delivered
> their messages by composing oracles—poetic speeches they recited in
> public. Unlike some other prophets, Isaiah had personal access to the
> kings of his day. He was able to bring godly counsel to kings Ahaz and
> Hezekiah when the powerful Assyrian Empire threatened the life of the
> nation. Isaiah maintains an international perspective throughout his
> book, revealing that Israel’s life is bound up with the affairs of the
> broader world.
> 
> Isaiah urges the people to care for the poor and needy, commit to
> follow God’s ways, and pursue social and economic justice. In typical
> prophetic pattern, he speaks of coming judgment because of Israel’s
> failure, but also of promised restoration, and moving from Israel to
> the wider world. God’s correction is in the service of
> renewal. Isaiah’s later oracles introduce the complex figure of the
> servant, whose personal sacrifice brings healing. These “servant
> songs” fit into the bigger picture of Israel’s return from exile, the
> Lord’s return to his people, and the nations turning to God. New
> Testament writers will turn to Isaiah often to explain how Israel’s
> ancient commission to bring blessing to the world was fulfilled.
