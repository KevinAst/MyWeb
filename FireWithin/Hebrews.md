# Hebrews

The book of Hebrews compares and contrasts Jesus to key historical
people and events from the Hebrew Bible. Through these comparisons, we
see his superiority. He is greater than the angels, the Torah, Moses,
the promised land, earthly priests, sacrifices, and the covenant. He
is the hope for a new creation, our eternal priest, and the perfect
sacrifice.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Hebrews Introduction**

> Neither the author nor the audience of this book is specifically
> named, but the book itself reveals its nature and purpose. The
> recipients are Jesus-believing Jews who are in danger of falling away
> from the faith. They are likely in Italy, since the author passes on
> greetings to them from those who are from Italy—probably their friends
> who are traveling elsewhere. The goal of the whole book is to show the
> superiority of the final realities God has revealed in the new
> covenant to the temporary ones of the first covenant. Its readers are
> encouraged to respond to the threat of persecution by recommitting to
> the new reality brought by Jesus.
> 
> The book alternates between teachings—reviews of Israel’s history or
> the temple worship arrangements—and challenges based on these
> teachings. There are four teaching-challenge pairs:
> 
> - Jesus and the salvation he brings are greater than the angels and
>   the salvation they announced (the law of Moses).
> 
> - Jesus is our “apostle” (someone sent by God on a specific mission),
>   and he brings us into a greater rest and promised land than Moses
>   and Joshua brought Israel into.
> 
> - Jesus is a more effective high priest than the priests appointed by
>   the law of Moses.
> 
> - As God’s faithful people have done throughout the ages, we must
>   continue living in light of God’s unseen heavenly realities and
>   stepping out in faith. Through the Messiah we are receiving a
>   kingdom that cannot be shaken.
