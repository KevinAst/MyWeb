# 2 Corinthians

Paul’s message to the Corinthians encourages them to live in a new
way, embracing the cruciform life of Jesus. Through the cross and
resurrection, Jesus’ followers can live differently and model
generosity, humility, and weakness. 2 Cornithians is a letter about
living in a totally counter-cultural way as we seek to live like Jesus
did.

2 Corinthians shows how God's strength is made perfect in
weakness. This is seen most clearly in Paul's dealings with the
so-called "Super Apostles" that had taken over leadership of the
church he planted in Corinth. The Super Apostles boasted in their
abilities, connections, and power. But Paul showed that, for those in
Christ, true power comes in weakness.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} 2 Corinthians Introduction**

> Paul’s first letter to the believers in Corinth gives us a glimpse
> into his deeply personal and tumultuous relationship with this
> gathering of Jesus-followers. The letter we know as 2 Corinthians
> further reveals the triumphs and struggles that result when life in
> the present age meets up with the in-breaking reality of God’s
> kingdom. Here we see Paul working to repair relationships, explain
> various changes in travel plans, make practical arrangements for
> collecting a gift for the struggling believers in Jerusalem, and
> directly confront challenges to his own leadership by the
> self-proclaimed “super-apostles.”
> 
> In the four main parts of the letter, each introduced by a reference
> to a place, Paul envisions himself in different locations, recalling
> or anticipating his relationship with the Corinthians. The single
> theme running through these sections is that God will comfort us in
> all our troubles, and we will offer this comfort to each other. This
> models the life of Jesus himself, who suffered first and then was
> comforted. Like the crucified Messiah, we are weak, yet we live in
> God’s power.
> 
> In the final section, however, Paul feels he has no choice but to make
> the Corinthians uncomfortable, to help them face their present
> condition. But he ends the letter hopefully, calling on them to
> rejoice in God’s grace, love and fellowship.
