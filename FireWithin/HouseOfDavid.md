**House of David** tells the story of the ascent of the biblical
figure, David, who becomes the most celebrated king of Israel. The
series follows the once-mighty King Saul as he falls victim to his own
pride. At the direction of God, the prophet Samuel anoints an
unlikely, outcast teenager as the new king. As one leader falls,
another must rise.
