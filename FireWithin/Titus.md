## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Titus Introduction**

> After the apostle Paul was released from prison in Rome, he discovered
> that renegade leaders were preying on the people of the church he had
> founded in Ephesus. He therefore left his long-time co-worker Timothy
> in that city with a letter authorizing him to replace these leaders
> and restore order. A similar situation on the island of Crete required
> Paul to commission another long-time co-worker, Titus, to act as his
> representative there.
> 
> Paul’s letter is addressed to Titus, but it is meant for the larger
> church as well. He confers his own authority on Titus and instructs
> him to appoint godly leaders. Paul’s description of the false teaching
> matches that in Ephesus: a combination of selective Jewish observances
> (such as being circumcised and abstaining from certain foods) and the
> pursuit of controversial speculations. However, the teaching didn’t
> help people live purer lives. Paul tells the community that the grace
> of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people.It is the true
> message about Jesus that helps God’s people live a new kind of
> life. Paul reveals his plan to spend the winter in Nicopolis, a city
> on the west coast of Macedonia. It would provide an excellent
> jumping-off point for bringing the gospel to the western part of the
> empire. He trusts that Titus will help restore order in Crete so he
> can accompany Paul on this new venture.
