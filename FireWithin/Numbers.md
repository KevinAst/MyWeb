# Numbers

Numbers tells the story of Israel’s wanderings through the wilderness
en route to the promised land of Canaan. Numbers begins and ends with
Moses counting all the people in the nation, which is how the book
gets its name.

Numbers shows us what it looks like to get trapped in the cycle of
sin. Whether it was Israel in the wilderness or ourselves in the city,
we all disobey and are headed toward punishment. Only Jesus can break
the cycle of sin, intercede for us, and bring us out of the wilderness
to himself.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Numbers Introduction**

> The books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers continue the story of how
> God formed the nation of Israel to play a special role in his plans
> for the whole world. When the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, God
> came to them and worked powerfully through Moses to deliver them. At
> Mount Sinai, God revealed his laws to Moses, including the Ten
> Commandments, and confirmed his covenant with the young nation. Israel
> built a “tabernacle,” or “tent of meeting,” so that God could live
> among them. The people then traveled through the wilderness to the
> land of Canaan.
> 
> The boundaries between the books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers are
> not sharply drawn. The key structure throughout the books relates to
> the various places the Israelites stopped on their journey. Each
> location is noted, and the events at each one are described. The key
> location is Mount Sinai; the second half of Exodus, all of Leviticus,
> and the beginning of Numbers describe what took place there. Leviticus
> specifically contains the laws and regulations the Lord gave to
> Israel. Numbers reports how the people were organized into a fighting
> force and moved toward the promised land.
> 
> Numbers reaches back across Leviticus and Exodus and repeats the
> phrase that structures Genesis: This is the account of the family of
> Aaron and Moses (Num. 3:1). Appropriately, we hear this phrase for the
> twelfth time as the twelve tribes are being organized into a
> nation. Near the end of Numbers the prophet Balaam says to Israel, May
> those who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed. This
> recalls God’s promise to Abraham in Genesis, I will bless those who
> bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse. These references show
> that together these books tell a single story of the beginning of
> God’s redemptive work in the world.
