# Settings

The _**"Fire Within"**_ Bible Study Guide has a small number of **User
Preference** settings _(found here)_, which are retained between
sessions.  In other words, you can leave the site and come back, and
these settings will be remembered.

> Please Note that these settings ares retained in your local device.
> That means they will not follow you when you use multiple devices
> _(say a laptop and a cell phone)_.  In other words, it's really the
> settings of the device you are using.
> 
> This feature is merely meant to be a convenience, and was
> implemented using the simplest technique.
