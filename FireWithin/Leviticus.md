# Leviticus

Leviticus can be summed up with God’s repeated command: “Be holy, as I
am holy.” Leviticus is a book of laws, but it’s also a book of
worship. This book is filled with details on how the people of God
should live, eat, sacrifice, celebrate, and more.

How can we live in God’s presence? The answer is given to us in the
book of Leviticus. If we are ever to dwell with God we must become
like God, we must be holy as he is holy. Atonement provided a
temporary way to take our darkness and make it light, but we needed a
more permanent solution. That is why Jesus, who is God's light itself,
took on our darkness to make us holy like him.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Leviticus Introduction**

> The books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers continue the story of how
> God formed the nation of Israel to play a special role in his plans
> for the whole world. When the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, God
> came to them and worked powerfully through Moses to deliver them. At
> Mount Sinai, God revealed his laws to Moses, including the Ten
> Commandments, and confirmed his covenant with the young nation. Israel
> built a “tabernacle,” or “tent of meeting,” so that God could live
> among them. The people then traveled through the wilderness to the
> land of Canaan.
> 
> The boundaries between the books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers are
> not sharply drawn. The key structure throughout the books relates to
> the various places the Israelites stopped on their journey. Each
> location is noted, and the events at each one are described. The key
> location is Mount Sinai; the second half of Exodus, all of Leviticus,
> and the beginning of Numbers describe what took place there. Leviticus
> specifically contains the laws and regulations the Lord gave to
> Israel. Numbers reports how the people were organized into a fighting
> force and moved toward the promised land.
> 
> Numbers reaches back across Leviticus and Exodus and repeats the
> phrase that structures Genesis: This is the account of the family of
> Aaron and Moses (Num. 3:1). Appropriately, we hear this phrase for the
> twelfth time as the twelve tribes are being organized into a
> nation. Near the end of Numbers the prophet Balaam says to Israel, May
> those who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed. This
> recalls God’s promise to Abraham in Genesis, I will bless those who
> bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse. These references show
> that together these books tell a single story of the beginning of
> God’s redemptive work in the world.
