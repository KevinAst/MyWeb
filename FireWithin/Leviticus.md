# Leviticus

Leviticus can be summed up with God’s repeated command: “Be holy, as I
am holy.” Leviticus is a book of laws, but it’s also a book of
worship. This book is filled with details on how the people of God
should live, eat, sacrifice, celebrate, and more.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Leviticus Introduction**

> The books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers continue the story of how
> God formed the nation of Israel to play a special role in his plans
> for the whole world. When the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, God
> came to them and worked powerfully through Moses to deliver them. At
> Mount Sinai, God revealed his laws to Moses, including the Ten
> Commandments, and confirmed his covenant with the young nation. Israel
> built a “tabernacle,” or “tent of meeting,” so that God could live
> among them. The people then traveled through the wilderness to the
> land of Canaan.
> 
> The boundaries between the books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers are
> not sharply drawn. The key structure throughout the books relates to
> the various places the Israelites stopped on their journey. Each
> location is noted, and the events at each one are described. The key
> location is Mount Sinai; the second half of Exodus, all of Leviticus,
> and the beginning of Numbers describe what took place there. Leviticus
> specifically contains the laws and regulations the Lord gave to
> Israel. Numbers reports how the people were organized into a fighting
> force and moved toward the promised land.
> 
> Numbers reaches back across Leviticus and Exodus and repeats the
> phrase that structures Genesis: This is the account of the family of
> Aaron and Moses (Num. 3:1). Appropriately, we hear this phrase for the
> twelfth time as the twelve tribes are being organized into a
> nation. Near the end of Numbers the prophet Balaam says to Israel, May
> those who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed. This
> recalls God’s promise to Abraham in Genesis, I will bless those who
> bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse. These references show
> that together these books tell a single story of the beginning of
> God’s redemptive work in the world.
