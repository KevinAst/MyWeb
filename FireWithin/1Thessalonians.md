Paul has heard a good report on the church at Thessalonica, and
encourages the persecuted believers to "excel still more" in faith,
hope, and love.

## Overview


**{{book.NivBible}} 1 Thessalonians Introduction**

> Around AD 51, Paul, Silas and Timothy brought the message about Jesus
> the Messiah to the city of Thessalonica. Many people became believers,
> but there was a riot when Paul and Silas were accused of defying
> Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus
> (see Acts 17:1-9). They narrowly escaped with their lives and had to
> flee.
> 
> A little later Paul became concerned that the believers in
> Thessalonica might fall away from the faith due to the opposition they
> were facing. So he sent Timothy to encourage them (as a Greek he could
> make the trip more safely). When Timothy returned to Achaia with the
> welcome news that the Thessalonians had remained faithful, Paul wrote
> to express his joy.
> 
> In this short letter, Paul first recalls his time in Thessalonica and
> gives thanks for their continuing faith, despite trials and
> challenges. He teaches them to avoid sexual immorality, to love one
> another sincerely, and to work hard to earn their own living.
> 
> Paul then addresses a key pastoral question: What is the Christian
> hope for those who have died? He explains that believers who die
> before the royal appearance of the Messiah are not lost, but will
> surely be raised from the dead when he comes. He reminds the
> Thessalonians that Jesus will appear suddenly and unexpectedly. They
> should therefore live in such a way that they would be unashamed to
> greet him. Throughout the letter Paul’s basic message is, “Keep up the
> good work!”
