## Memorize God's Word

This section contains selected scriptures that you may consider
committing to memory.

For me, this began in 2025, when my local church ({{book.FBM}})
started a campaign to memorize God's Word.  It was called **[25 in
25](https://fbmaryville.org/25-in-25)** - memorizing 25 passages in
2025, focused on five different themes.

I have always struggled with this, so I created this page as an aid.
For each passage:

- A link is provided into the [You Version](https://www.bible.com/)
  Bible App, that you can use to dig deeper.

- You may select your preferred Bible translation _(from 4 of the most
  popular translations)_.  The page will remember your selection
  **(_for each individual passage_)**.

- An audio playback is provided, that can be used to audibly practice
  your memorization.

- You can keep track of your progress, by simply checking the passages
  you have memorized!

Lord Bless You!

If we want to have a new life (eternal life), we must deny ourselves
and give up our lives (our own way of living) here on earth.
 
Denying ourselves is the hardest part. In fact, the world teaches
something completely different. The world says, "follow your heart" or
"live your truth." Meanwhile, someone laying down their desires to be
obedient to Jesus is considered extreme and down right crazy.
 
Did you know that the basis for salvation is a denial of self?
 
To repent of sin (turn from sin) and ask for forgiveness (help) from
God is a denial of self. At our core we want to sin. Only with the
Holy Spirit's help can we take this first step of self denial (turning
from sin). And the same is true about each and every step of self
denial.
 
The Holy Spirit is our helper in denying ourselves, taking up our
cross daily, and following Jesus. Simply put, obedience is laying down
what we want in order to trust that God knows better than we do.
