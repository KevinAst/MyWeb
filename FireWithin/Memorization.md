### Overview

This section contains selected scriptures that you may consider
committing to memory.

For me, this began in 2025, when my local church ({{book.FBM}})
started a campaign to memorize God's Word.  It is called **[25 in
25](https://fbmaryville.org/25-in-25)** - memorizing 25 passages in
2025, focused on five different themes.

I have always struggled with memorization, **_<mark>so I created this page as
an aid</mark>_**.  

For each passage:

- An audio playback is provided, that can be used to listen repeatedly
  **_(ingraining it into your memory)_**.  When you click the play
  button the passage will repeat over and over, till you click stop!.

- You may select your preferred Bible translation _(from 6 of the most
  popular translations)_.  Your selection will be remembered **_for
  each individual passage_**.

- A link is provided into the [You Version](https://www.bible.com/)
  Bible App ... **_so that you can dig deeper_**.

- As always, you can keep track of your progress, by simply checking
  the passages you have memorized!

Lord Bless You!

If we want to have a new life (eternal life), we must deny ourselves
and give up our lives (our own way of living) here on earth.
 
Denying ourselves is the hardest part. In fact, the world teaches
something completely different. The world says, "follow your heart" or
"live your truth." Meanwhile, someone laying down their desires to be
obedient to Jesus is considered extreme and down right crazy.
 
Did you know that the basis for salvation is a denial of self?
 
To repent of sin (turn from sin) and ask for forgiveness (help) from
God is a denial of self. At our core we want to sin. Only with the
Holy Spirit's help can we take this first step of self denial (turning
from sin). And the same is true about each and every step of self
denial.
 
The Holy Spirit is our helper in denying ourselves, taking up our
cross daily, and following Jesus. Simply put, obedience is laying down
what we want in order to trust that God knows better than we do.

What we think about is important. We Often allow our minds
to wander and end up in some pretty dark places. It's when
we allow our thoughts to reach their conclusion that we get
in trouble. 

Instead, we should "take every thought captive to obey Christ" (2
Corinthians 10:5). 

LINK: 2 Corinthians 10:5 - https://bible.com/bible/59/2co.10.5.ESV

In Philippians 4:8, the Apostle Paul teaches us how to begin taking
every thought captive. 

Next time you have a thought you can ask, "Is this line of thinking
true, noble, or right? Are these thoughts pure, lovely, or
admirable? 

P{ inject('<div class="indent">') }P

Is this an excellent or praiseworthy way of thinking?" 

If the answer to any of these questions is "NO" , then you know
what to do. Take those thoughts captive and bring them into
obedience to Christ.  Allow the Holy Spirit to lead you in truth
instead of your thoughts leading you into dark places.
