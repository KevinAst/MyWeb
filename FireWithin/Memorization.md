### Overview

This section contains selected scriptures that you may consider
committing to memory.

P{ collapsibleSection({
  id:     'memVerseOverview',
  label:  'Tell Me More',
}) }P

For me, this journey began in 2025, when my local church
({{book.FBM}}) launched a memorization campaign called **[25 in
25](https://fbmaryville.org/25-in-25)** — aimed at memorizing 25
passages in 2025, each focused on one of five key themes.

I’ve always struggled with memorization, so **_<mark>this page was
created as as a helpful resource</mark>_**.

For each passage:

- An _**audio playback is provided**_, that allows you to listen to
  the passage repeatedly. The playback _**automatically loops**_ until
  you click stop - making it easy to hear the scripture
  continuously. When using this feature on your phone, you can simply
  _**pop in your earbuds and let the scripture take root in your
  memory!**_

  Each audio playback includes the following elements:  

  - **Context** (e.g., _Paul's parting instruction to the church at Philippi_)  
  - **Scripture Reference** (e.g., _Philippians 4:8_)  
  - **Translation** (e.g., _New Living Translation_)  
  - **Scripture Passage** (recited in the selected translation)  
  - **Scripture Reference** (repeated – per recommendation of The [Navigators'](https://www.navigators.org/))


- You can choose your preferred Bible translation from a selection of
  the most popular versions.  _**Your choice will be remembered for
  each individual passage** (once it is explicitly selected)_!

- A scripture link is provided to the [You Version](https://www.bible.com/)
  Bible App, so you can explore the passage in greater depth.

- As always, you can _**track your progress by checking the completion
  box next to the passages you've memorized!**_

- This page includes several collapsible sections, such as the
  devotional content for each memory verse, and even this
  overview. You can toggle these sections by clicking their titles
  _(shown with an arrow)_. Collapsing them helps better promote the
  memory verses _(making them more prominent)_. The collapsed state is
  preserved, so when you leave and return, everything will appear just
  as you left it.

Currently, there are only a few passages on this page.  I am following
the **[25 in 25](https://fbmaryville.org/25-in-25)** campaign, and
will be adding passages from that resource throughout the year.

In addition, I plan to add more scriptures to this list.  If you have
one that you would like added, please reach out to me
at <span id="inquire"></span>

Lord Bless You!

If we want to have a new life (eternal life), we must deny ourselves
and give up our lives (our own way of living) here on earth.
 
Denying ourselves is the hardest part. In fact, the world teaches
something completely different. The world says, "follow your heart" or
"live your truth." Meanwhile, someone laying down their desires to be
obedient to Jesus is considered extreme and down right crazy.
 
Did you know that the basis for salvation is a denial of self?
 
To repent of sin (turn from sin) and ask for forgiveness (help) from
God is a denial of self. At our core we want to sin. Only with the
Holy Spirit's help can we take this first step of self denial (turning
from sin). And the same is true about each and every step of self
denial.
 
_**The Holy Spirit is our helper**_ in denying ourselves, taking up our
cross daily, and following Jesus. Simply put, obedience is laying down
what we want in order to trust that God knows better than we do.

What we think about is important. We Often allow our minds
to wander and end up in some pretty dark places. It's when
we allow our thoughts to reach their conclusion that we get
in trouble. 

Instead, we should "_take every thought captive to obey Christ_"
[2 Corinthians 10:5 ESV](https://bible.com/bible/59/2co.10.5.ESV).

In M{ bibleLink(`php.4.8@@Philippians 4:8`) }M, the Apostle Paul
teaches us how to begin taking every thought captive.

Next time you have a thought you can ask:

- Is this line of thinking true, honorable, or right?
  
- Are these thoughts pure, lovely, or admirable?
  
- Is this an excellent or praiseworthy way of thinking?

If the answer to any of these questions is "NO", then you know
what to do. 

- Take those thoughts captive and bring them into obedience to Christ.

- _**Allow the Holy Spirit to lead you in truth**_ instead of your
  thoughts leading you into dark places.

    NLT:   `And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice—the kind he will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship him.

Knowing that our thoughts direct our behaviors, renewing our mind
becomes our greatest transformational aspiration.

With a renewed mind, we are able to discern what is God's will and
what is a scheme of the evil one.  _**In other words, we can better
understand God's ways versus the ways of the world.**_

Once we are able to discern these things, it becomes possible for us
to _offer our bodies to God as a living sacrifice_.  _**We can walk in
obedience to Him.**_ _We are pleasing to Him!_

God is patient and kind. 

However, many times we mistake His patience and kindness as a lack of
response. We begin fooling ourselves into thinking sin isn't sin or
that God isn't real because there was no immediate consequence for our
sin.

This verse tells us that _**it's His kindness that leads to
repentance**_. Without His kindness, we wouldn't even have a chance to
repent. 

_**Thank God for His kindness today!**_
