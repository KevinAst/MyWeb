### Overview

This page contains _**selected scriptures that you may consider
committing to memory**_.

For me, this journey began in 2020, when God got my attention and took
hold of my life.  I have a bit of a prodigal son story _(I share more
about my Christian faith in the {{book.MyFaith}} page)_.

Recently, my local church ({{book.FBM}}) launched a memorization
campaign called **[25 in 25](https://fbmaryville.org/25-in-25)** — a
challenge to memorize 25 passages in 2025, each centered on one of
five themes.

Memorization has always been a challenge for me. This time, however,
rather than using that as an excuse, I felt God directing me to do
something about it. _**This page is the result — <mark>one I hope will
be a helpful resource</mark>.**_

P{ collapsibleSection({
  id:     'memVerseOverview',
  label:  'Tell Me More',
  initialExpansion: 'close',
}) }P

Explore the features of this page _(along with some quick tips on how to use them)_:.

- _**Audio Playback**_: You can listen to each passage _**on repeat**_ until
  you stop it. This is especially handy on your phone — _**just pop in
  your earbuds and let the Scripture take root in your memory!**_

  This is the **<mark>key feature</mark>** of this page and _**the
  reason I created it**_ :-)

  You will find the **Audio Playback Control** after each scripture
  _(below)_.  The following elements are included for each audio:

  - **Context** (e.g., _Paul's parting instruction to the church at Philippi_)  
  - **Scripture Reference** (e.g., _Philippians 4:8_)  
  - **Translation** (e.g., _New Living Translation_)  
  - **Scripture Passage** (recited in the selected translation)  
  - **Scripture Reference** (repeated – per recommendation of The [Navigators'](https://www.navigators.org/))


- _**Customizable Translations**_: For each memory verse, you may
  select the Bible translation you wish to memorize, from a selection
  of the most popular versions.

  Initially, the default translation _(promoted by the **[25 in
  25](https://fbmaryville.org/25-in-25)** campaign)_ will be selected,
  and **it's selector will always be shown in red**.

- _**YouVersion Links**_: Each memory verse is a link to the
  [YouVersion](https://www.bible.com/) Bible App, so you can explore
  the passage in greater depth.

- _**Progress Tracking**_: As is the case with several aspects of this
  {{book.FireWithin}} site, you can keep track of your progress _(in 
  this case - the verses you have memorized)_ with the "completed"
  check boxes ✔.

- _**Minimalist View**_: You can collapse both this overview and
  devotional sections found in this page - **to give more prominence to
  the scripture itself**.  

  Simply click the title of any collapsible section _(indicated by an
  arrow - ▶)_, to toggle between expanded and collapsed views.

- _**Multi-Verse Playback**_: In addition to listening to each
  individual memory verse _(one at a time)_, you can choose to listen
  to multiple verses of your choosing.  This audio control is at the
  top of the page _(just under the **Table of Contents**)_.

  You simply select the verses you want to review _(through the
  &#x1F508; audio checkboxes to the right of each verse in the TOC)_,
  and click play on the audio control.

- _**Total Recall**_: All these settings are automatically saved, so when
  you return to the site, it will be just as you left it.

  > **Please Note**: By default these settings are stored locally on
  > your device. This works well when you are using a single device.  
  > 
  > If however you use multiple devices _(say your laptop and your
  > phone)_, each one will have their own settings _(that you must sync
  > manually)_.  **To solve this problem**, you simply create a **FireWithin
  > Account** (on the {{book.Settings}} page) - which then saves your
  > settings to the cloud, and any device signed-in to this account
  > will sync automatically!

Currently, there are only a few passages on this page.  I am following
the **[25 in 25](https://fbmaryville.org/25-in-25)** campaign, and
will be adding passages from that resource throughout the year.

I also plan to add additional scriptures to this page.  _**Would you like
to see a particular passage added?**_ Reach out to me at <span
id="inquire"></span>

Lord Bless You!

If we want to have a new life (eternal life), we must deny ourselves
and give up our lives (our own way of living) here on earth.
 
Denying ourselves is the hardest part. In fact, the world teaches
something completely different. The world says, "follow your heart" or
"live your truth." Meanwhile, someone laying down their desires to be
obedient to Jesus is considered extreme and down right crazy.
 
Did you know that the basis for salvation is a denial of self?
 
To repent of sin (turn from sin) and ask for forgiveness (help) from
God is a denial of self. At our core we want to sin. Only with the
Holy Spirit's help can we take this first step of self denial (turning
from sin). And the same is true about each and every step of self
denial.
 
_**The Holy Spirit is our helper**_ in denying ourselves, taking up our
cross daily, and following Jesus. Simply put, obedience is laying down
what we want in order to trust that God knows better than we do.

What we think about is important. We Often allow our minds
to wander and end up in some pretty dark places. It's when
we allow our thoughts to reach their conclusion that we get
in trouble. 

Instead, we should "_take every thought captive to obey Christ_"
[2 Corinthians 10:5 ESV](https://bible.com/bible/59/2co.10.5.ESV).

In M{ bibleLink(`php.4.8@@Philippians 4:8`) }M, the Apostle Paul
teaches us how to begin taking every thought captive.

Next time you have a thought you can ask:

- Is this line of thinking true, honorable, or right?
  
- Are these thoughts pure, lovely, or admirable?
  
- Is this an excellent or praiseworthy way of thinking?

If the answer to any of these questions is "NO", then you know
what to do. 

- Take those thoughts captive and bring them into obedience to Christ.

- _**Allow the Holy Spirit to lead you in truth**_ instead of your
  thoughts leading you into dark places.

Knowing that our thoughts direct our behaviors, renewing our mind
becomes our greatest transformational aspiration.

With a renewed mind, we are able to discern what is God's will and
what is a scheme of the evil one.  _**In other words, we can better
understand God's ways versus the ways of the world.**_

Once we are able to discern these things, it becomes possible for us
to _offer our bodies to God as a living sacrifice_.  _**We can walk in
obedience to Him.**_ _We are pleasing to Him!_

God is patient and kind. 

However, many times we mistake His patience and kindness as a lack of
response. We begin fooling ourselves into thinking sin isn't sin or
that God isn't real because there was no immediate consequence for our
sin.

This verse tells us that _**it's His kindness that leads to
repentance**_. Without His kindness, we wouldn't even have a chance to
repent. 

_**Thank God for His kindness today!**_
