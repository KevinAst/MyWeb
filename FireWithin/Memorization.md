### Overview

This section contains selected scriptures that you may consider
committing to memory.

For me, this journey began in 2025, when my local church
({{book.FBM}}) launched a memorization campaign called **[25 in
25](https://fbmaryville.org/25-in-25)** — aimed at memorizing 25
passages in 2025, each focused on one of five key themes.

I’ve always struggled with memorization, so **_<mark>this page was
created as as a helpful resource</mark>_**.

For each passage:

- An _**audio playback is provided**_, that allows you to listen to
  the passage repeatedly. The playback _**automatically loops**_ until
  you click stop, making it easy to hear the scripture
  continuously. When using this feature on your phone, you can simply
  _**pop in your earbuds and let the scripture take root in your
  memory!**_

- You can choose your preferred Bible translation from a selection of
  the most popular versions.  _**Your choice will be remembered for
  each individual passage** (once it is explicitly selected)_!

- A scripture link is provided to the [You Version](https://www.bible.com/)
  Bible App, so you can explore the passage in greater depth.

- As always, you can _**track your progress by checking the completion
  box next to the passages you've memorized!**_

- ?? OLD: The [Navigators'](https://www.navigators.org/) approach to scripture
  memorization involves reciting the scripture reference both before
  and after the passage. _**It's important not to forget the
  'address'!**_ :-) However, because our audio playback automatically
  loops, this effect has been implicitly achieved. As a result, the
  audio only announces the reference at the beginning _(along with the
  Bible translation)_.

- Regarding the audio playback: 

  * I follow the [Navigators'](https://www.navigators.org/) approach
    to Scripture memorization, which involves reciting the Scripture
    reference both before and after the passage. _**Remembering the
    'address' is important!**_ :-)

  * Additionally, I find it helpful to include a brief context of the
    Scripture _(in the first reference)_ and specify the translation
    used _(in the second reference)_.

Currently, there are only a few passages on this page.  I am following
the **[25 in 25](https://fbmaryville.org/25-in-25)** campaign, and
will be adding passages from that resource throughout the year.

In addition, I plan to add more scriptures to this list.  If you have
one that you would like added, please reach out to me

If we want to have a new life (eternal life), we must deny ourselves
and give up our lives (our own way of living) here on earth.
 
Denying ourselves is the hardest part. In fact, the world teaches
something completely different. The world says, "follow your heart" or
"live your truth." Meanwhile, someone laying down their desires to be
obedient to Jesus is considered extreme and down right crazy.
 
Did you know that the basis for salvation is a denial of self?
 
To repent of sin (turn from sin) and ask for forgiveness (help) from
God is a denial of self. At our core we want to sin. Only with the
Holy Spirit's help can we take this first step of self denial (turning
from sin). And the same is true about each and every step of self
denial.
 
_**The Holy Spirit is our helper**_ in denying ourselves, taking up our
cross daily, and following Jesus. Simply put, obedience is laying down
what we want in order to trust that God knows better than we do.

What we think about is important. We Often allow our minds
to wander and end up in some pretty dark places. It's when
we allow our thoughts to reach their conclusion that we get
in trouble. 

Instead, we should "_take every thought captive to obey Christ_"
[2 Corinthians 10:5 ESV](https://bible.com/bible/59/2co.10.5.ESV).

In M{ bibleLink(`php.4.8@@2 Philippians 4:8`) }M, the Apostle Paul
teaches us how to begin taking every thought captive.

Next time you have a thought you can ask:

- Is this line of thinking true, honorable, or right?
  
- Are these thoughts pure, lovely, or admirable?
  
- Is this an excellent or praiseworthy way of thinking?

If the answer to any of these questions is "NO", then you know
what to do. 

- Take those thoughts captive and bring them into obedience to Christ.

- _**Allow the Holy Spirit to lead you in truth**_ instead of your
  thoughts leading you into dark places.
