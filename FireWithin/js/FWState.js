/**
 * The FWState class manages a "category" of state (e.g. "settings",
 * or "completions"), simplifying a number of integration points
 * (persistence, and reactivity).
 *
 * The characteristics of this class are:
 *
 *   - It holds a "category" of state (think "settings" or "completions").
 *
 *     A collection of key/value pairs are maintained, which
 *     constitutes the complete state for this given category.
 * 
 *     This provides the launch-point for the overall management and
 *     persistence of data in this category.
 *
 *   - A "basic" API is provided to get/set individual properties (key/value)
 *     of this category.
 *
 *     Typically, this API should be considered INTERNAL, as it is
 *     somewhat cryptic.  It is easy to provide a more specific API
 *     that is more tailored to this category (more on this later).
 *         
 *   - Persistence of state is automatically provided, triggered
 *     by changes made to individual properties.
 *
 *     Two types of persistence are supported, which automatically
 *     adjusts (based on User Authentication):
 *
 *       * LocalStorage (for Guest users)
 *       * Firebase DB  (for signed-in users)
 *
 *   - Reactivity is "built-in", supporting UI synchronization, 
 *     through emitted events, triggered by state changes.
 *                 
 *     The scope of this synchronization is as follows:
 *
 *       * LocalStorage (for Guest users):
 *         >>> Syncing multiple app instances on same device/browser
 *
 *       * Firebase DB (for signed-in users):
 *         >>> Syncing multiple app instances on ALL devices of the same user
 *
 * Usage patterns of this class are as follows:
 *                 
 *   - Please Note: You can see examples of this usage pattern in:
 *       * fwCompletions.js
 *       * fwSettings.js
 *                 
 *   - A unique FWState singleton instance should be created for a
 *     given state category.
 *
 *     The reason a single instance should be utilized is related to
 *     the various setup and registrations that are maintained for
 *     each category.  The FWState instance is mutated for state
 *     changes, so a single reference to this object will always have
 *     the most up-to-date content.
 *
 *   - Typically, a higher-level class instance is promoted to the
 *     client, providing the PUBLIC API.  This is more tailored to a
 *     specific category of state.  Remember, the FWState API is more
 *     basic (using key/value pairs).
 *
 *     In essence, this client class simply wraps the FWState instance
 *     as it's underlying state ... ultimately passing requests
 *     through to it for the underlying work.  Under the covers the
 *     internal FWState instance does the heavy lifting!

   *
   * - This is invoked both for app start-up -AND- when the user identity 
   *   changes.
   *
   * - This process includes the necessary registrations that are
   *   required to synchronize our in-memory-state from external changes
   *   to the persistent-store.
   *
   * MORE CONTEXT ...
   *
   * Terminology:
   *   - in-memory-state:  the app's in-memory state representation 
   *                       ... i.e. JavaScript variables
   *   - persistent-store: a database that retains the active user's state
   *                       over multiple runs of the application.
   *                       * EITHER:
   *                         - the Central Cloud Firebase DB (for authorized users)
   *                         - or the Device's Browser LocalStorage (for guest users)
   *                       * the synchronization between these two persistent-stores
   *                         is very limited:
   *                         1. when a BRAND NEW user establishes their account (the first time they sign-in)
   *                            - the initial Firebase image is set from the Device Storage (see: "SideBar (Initial Firebase DB Image)")
   *                         2. when the user signs-out
   *                            - the Device Storage can be synced from the Firebase image, per user request (see: "SideBar (Sync Device Storage From Cloud on Sign-Out)")
   *
   * Invocation Context:
   *  - this function is invoked:
   *     1. once - on app start-up (with our default guest user - before user sign-in OR re-authentication occurs)
   *        ... via: direct invocation in our constructor
   *     2. whenever the user identity changes (i.e. sign-in, re-authentication, sign-out)
   *        ... via: fwUser.onChange() registration
   *
   * "Setup" involves the following things:
   *
   *   - registers processes that will synchronize in-memory-state, 
   *     from subsequent changes to the user's persistent-store
   *     ... ex: other devices signed-in with the same user
   *
   *   - initialize (or reset) our in-memory-state from the user's persistent-store
   *     * because the user identity has changed (see context above), their state will be different
   *     * for signed-in users, their in-memory-state is reflective of the Firebase DB
   *     * for signed-out users, their in-memory-state is reflective of the Device LocalStorage
   *
   *   > SideBar (Initial Firebase DB Image):
   *   - this process also detects a non-existent persistent-store (for a BRAND NEW user account),
   *     and establishes the persistent-store's initial state for that user
   *     * this is done ONE TIME (per user), for a BRAND NEW user
   *       ... the first time they establish their account
   *     * the initial state is defined from the current in-memory-state of a guest user
   *       - because sign-in always happens from a guest user state
   *       - KEY: if the guest user has been using MULTIPLE devices,
   *              their account creation (i.e. first-time sign-in)
   *              should be done on the device that has the most accurate state!
   *       - ultimately, first-time guest user state is initialized from default semantics
   *
   *   > SideBar (Sync Device Storage From Cloud on Sign-Out):
   *   - on sign-out, this process will conditionally sync the Device LocalStorage from the Firebase DB
   *     * per user request (in fwSettings)
   *
   * App start-up progression of in-memory-state (highlighting our default semantics):
   *   0. Our initial state ALWAYS contains the appropriate default semantics, as follows:
   *   1. Our in-memory-state is initialized with our default semantics:
   *      - the FWState class constructor accepts the ONE-AND-ONLY defaultSemantis param
   *      - NOTE: this step 1 is very short-lived, as step 2 happens immediately
   *   2. Once our app start-up initially invokes THIS function, our in-memory-state will be reset
   *      from the Device's Browser LocalStorage
   *      - because the initial user will be a guest user
   *      - see: fetchStateFromDevice()
   *             * invoked from THIS function's signed-out logic path
   *             * when NO localStorage exists, fetchStateFromDevice() falls back to our existing in-memory-state
   *               - WHICH HAS the default semantics built-in (see step 1)
   *   3. If and when authentication occurs (either a sign-in or re-authentication)
   *      our in-memory-state will be reset from the user's persistent-store.
   *      - which in-turn, has initially been defined from our in-memory-state (initialized from step 1/2)
   *        * WHICH HAS the default semantics built-in

//********************************************************************************
//* syncDeviceStoreOnSignOut - Sync Device Storage From Cloud on Sign-Out
//* 
//* The determination of when to "Sync Device Storage From Cloud on
//* Sign-Out" is made in this module (see: usage in setupOnUserChange()
//* function).
//* 
//* Ultimately this is driven by an fwSetting property:
//* fwSetting.isSyncDeviceStoreOnSignOut().
//* 
//* HOWEVER there are two quirky aspects of why we cannot directly use
//* fwSetting to make this determination:
//* 
//* 1. This process occurs multiple times for a sign-out, because we have
//*    multiple state categories.
//* 
//*    In other words, there are separate instances of FWState, one for
//*    each state category (e.g. completions and settings).
//* 
//* 2. This process is actually changing the source of our settings (going
//*    from Firebase to Device LocalStorage), so it can be unstable.
//* 
//*    We want the Firebase rendition, but the settings may have already
//*    changed to the LocalStorage rendition - because of the multiple
//*    object instances highlighted in step 1.
//* 
//* As a result, the determination is made early in the sign-out process
//* (see: signOut() function in fwAuth.js), and retain it here using the
//* retain_syncDeviceStoreOnSignOut() function below.
