// retain our auth object
// NOTES:
//   - IT IS OK to retain in module scope (Firebase will auto-sync on change)
const auth = getAuth();

// Create/Promote our one-and-only singleton fwUser object
// NOTES:
//  - The returned fwUser represents the one-and-only singleton,
//    which ALWAYS represents the active user (i.e. it is morphed in-place)!
//    As a result, you can hold onto this (say in module scope) 
//    and know it is always accurate.
//  - initially, this object has our default representation of a signed-out user
//    HOWEVER, that will change once re-authentication takes place
export const fwUser = new FWUser();

// monitor Firebase authorization changes (via firebase observer)
//   Examples:
//     - a user sign-in ............ triggered when authentication is successfully completed
//     - a user re-authenticated ... can be many times, because an authenticated user is long-lived (per device)
//     - a user sign-out ........... triggered when sign-out is completed
//   NOTE: fbUser parameter:
//           - is the SAME as auth.currentUser
//             * is synced automatically by Firebase (under the covers)
//           - available properties: 
//             ... https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/auth.user
//                 ex: auth.currentUser.uid
//           - WHEN signed-out, fbUser IS null
//           - WHEN signed-in,  fbUser IS defined -AND- BOTH fbUser.uid/fbUser.email are defined
//                                                      BECAUSE: we are using email authentication exclusively
