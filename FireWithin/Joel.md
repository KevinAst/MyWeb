# Joel

Joel prophesies about a coming day of the Lord — a day of both justice
and mercy. On that day, there will be justice against those who have
made themselves God's enemies and mercy for all those who lament and
repent of their sins. Joel also prophesies that God's mercy includes a
promise to pour out his Holy Spirit on all people. The good news of
the book of Joel is that everyone who calls out to God will be saved.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Joel Introduction**

> The exact date of the book of Joel is difficult to know, since it does
> not refer to the reign of any particular king. The specific occasion
> of the book, however, is very clear and Joel uses this occasion to
> deliver a powerful spiritual message.
> 
> The book begins by graphically describing how a swarm of locusts has
> overrun the land of Judah and eaten everything in sight. After calling
> for the people to repent in response to this disaster, the book offers
> a detailed description of the locust swarm itself. The locusts are
> like an invading army, with God at their head. Joel asserts that the
> day of the Lord—a day of judgment—has come. He renews his call for
> repentance through fasting, community prayer and heartfelt
> contrition. In response, he promises that God will not only drive the
> locusts away, but restore more than they have devoured. He foretells
> God’s defeat of all the nations that oppose his people, and how God
> will pour out his Spirit on the survivors in Judah. If the people
> return to the Lord with all of their hearts, they will see the return
> of their prosperity when the day of the Lord arrives.
