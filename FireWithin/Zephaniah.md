# Zephaniah

The book of Zephaniah contains some of the most intense images of
God's justice and hope found in the prophetic books. Zephaniah warns
Israel and the surrounding nations that the Day of the Lord is
near. God will judge the nations with a burning fire as he purifies
them from sin, evil, and violence.

But the coming Day of the Lord is not without hope. It will remove
evil from among God’s people and open up a new future where all
humanity can flourish in peace.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Zephaniah Introduction**

> The reign of King Manasseh of Judah was the time of greatest
> corruption, injustice and paganism in Judah’s history. But Manasseh’s
> grandson King Josiah reasserted the nation’s faith and obedience to
> God and its independence from foreign empires. One reason for this
> seems to be that a member of his court stood up and warned that
> Judah’s breaking of the covenant had led it to the brink of
> destruction. The person who offered this warning was the prophet
> Zephaniah.
> 
> The book’s prologue identifies Zephaniah as the great-great-grandson
> of Hezekiah. No other prophet’s ancestry is traced back four
> generations, so this seems intended to associate Zephaniah with the
> great reforming king of Judah. It is likely that Zephaniah was of
> royal blood, since he was familiar with particular districts in
> Jerusalem and with specific activities in the capital.
> 
> This collection of prophecies has three main parts. First is a
> description of the day of the Lord that is coming against Judah and
> Jerusalem. Next is a call for national repentance, along with oracles
> of destruction against the Philistines, Moabites, Cushites
> (Ethiopians), Assyrians and Jerusalem itself. In the final section,
> Zephaniah promises that God will restore a humble remnant when he
> returns as a Mighty Warrior among his people.
