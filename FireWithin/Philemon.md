# Philemon

One of Paul's shortest and the most explosive letters, the book of
Philemon demonstrates the Gospel through action. It's written to
Philemon whose slave Onesimus ran away and became a believer under
Paul's teaching.

Paul urges Philemon to forgive Onesimus and accept him back as an
equal. Because they are both followers of Jesus, God's grace has made
them partners under the new humanity that Jesus has established.

While Paul doesn't mention Jesus' death and resurrection directly in
this letter, he offers to take on any punishment Onesimus deserves, a
demonstration of what Jesus did on the cross. He encourages Philemon
to do the same as he reconciles to Onesimus before God.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Philemon Introduction**

> One of the people Paul chose to deliver the letters we know as
> Colossians and Ephesians was a man named Onesimus. Onesimus was
> originally from Colossae, and would have been known to the people
> there. But Paul was compelled to write a separate letter for him. This
> was because Onesimus had been the slave of a wealthy Colossian named
> Philemon, in whose home the church met. Onesimus had run away,
> probably robbing Philemon in the process. In Rome he had become a
> follower of Jesus. He’d been helping Paul in prison, but now Paul
> needed him to return to Colossae. Paul’s hope was that Philemon would
> not only forgive Onesimus, but welcome him as a brother and no longer
> a slave.
> 
> Paul’s brief letter to Philemon stresses the change in Onesimus’s
> life. His name meant useful in Greek, and Paul tells Philemon that
> while he had formerly been useless (a servant Philemon couldn’t count
> on), now he could be useful to both of them. Paul doesn’t put Philemon
> under any obligation. His appeal is on the basis of love, and he
> promises to honor the demands of justice by making restitution himself
> if necessary.
> 
> Most likely Paul’s appeal was successful, or this letter would not
> have been preserved. In the life of Onesimus we have a clear example
> of the kind of transformation that occurred in thousands of lives as
> the gospel message spread throughout the Roman Empire.
