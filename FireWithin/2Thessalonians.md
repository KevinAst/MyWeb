# 2 Thessalonians

Paul addresses three troubles the church in Thessalonica faced:
Persecution from outside
&bull; Despair from false doctrine
&bull; Busybodies in the church.

Paul's two letters to the Thessalonians talk more explicitly about
Jesus' second coming than, perhaps, any of Paul's other
letters. That's because these believers were oppressed, persecuted,
and especially needed the hope of Jesus' return. Jesus would not only
return to heal and restore them but also bring justice against those
oppressing them.

## Overview


**{{book.NivBible}} 2 Thessalonians Introduction**

> Apparently only shortly after writing his first letter to the
> Thessalonians, Paul had to write again to correct a false report that
> he had said the day of the Lord had already come. The day of the
> Lord was a phrase from the Hebrew prophets to describe God’s key
> victory over every opponent, when his faithful ones would be
> rewarded. The Thessalonians’ concern seems to have been not that the
> day had come and gone and they had missed it, but that it was now
> present. That would mean nothing more was to be expected from God in
> terms of setting things right. Since they continued to suffer
> persecutions, this was a depressing prospect.
> 
> Even before he contradicts this false report, Paul reassures the
> Thessalonians that God will indeed pay back all those who were
> troubling them. He reminds them of the details he had discussed with
> them in person of how the day of the Lord would arrive. He then
> repeats some instruction from his earlier letter, urging them not to
> be idle but to work hard and earn their own livings.
> 
> At the end of the letter, most of which would have been written by a
> scribe, Paul adds a greeting in his own handwriting. He wants them to
> know for sure this teaching is really coming from him!
