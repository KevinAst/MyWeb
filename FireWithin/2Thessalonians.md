## Overview


**{{book.NivBible}} 2 Thessalonians Introduction**

> Apparently only shortly after writing his first letter to the
> Thessalonians, Paul had to write again to correct a false report that
> he had said the day of the Lord had already come. The day of the
> Lord was a phrase from the Hebrew prophets to describe God’s key
> victory over every opponent, when his faithful ones would be
> rewarded. The Thessalonians’ concern seems to have been not that the
> day had come and gone and they had missed it, but that it was now
> present. That would mean nothing more was to be expected from God in
> terms of setting things right. Since they continued to suffer
> persecutions, this was a depressing prospect.
> 
> Even before he contradicts this false report, Paul reassures the
> Thessalonians that God will indeed pay back all those who were
> troubling them. He reminds them of the details he had discussed with
> them in person of how the day of the Lord would arrive. He then
> repeats some instruction from his earlier letter, urging them not to
> be idle but to work hard and earn their own livings.
> 
> At the end of the letter, most of which would have been written by a
> scribe, Paul adds a greeting in his own handwriting. He wants them to
> know for sure this teaching is really coming from him!
