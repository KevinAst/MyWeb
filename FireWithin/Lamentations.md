# Lamentations

Lamentations is like a eulogy. But instead of mourning a loved one's
passing, this book laments over the death of Israel and her
temple. The mourners admit they are responsible for Israel's demise
and they grieve the possibility that they have been utterly rejected
by God. But in the middle of their grief, there is a message of
hopeâ€“God's mercies are new every morning!

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Lamentations Introduction**

> When the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem and deported much of its
> population, some residents were left behind in terrible conditions in
> and around the shattered city. To express their deep shame and grief
> over the destruction of their home, they wrote songs about its
> desolation and about the sufferings they were witnessing and
> experiencing. The book of Lamentations does not tell us who wrote
> these songs, although tradition ascribes them to Jeremiah. Here we
> witness people of faith putting into words their struggle to
> understand how God could have allowed the city they loved to be so
> devastated.
> 
> Each of the five songs preserved in the book has 22 stanzas. The first
> four songs begin with the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet in
> consecutive order. In the third song the letters are repeated at the
> start of each of the three lines in the stanza. There are few
> expressions of hope, but they are placed in the center of the book to
> give them extra prominence in a situation where they are badly
> needed. Overall, this collection of laments reminds us that expressing
> anguish over a broken, fallen world is a legitimate part of the
> biblical drama.
