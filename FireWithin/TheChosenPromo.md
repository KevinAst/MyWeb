# The Chosen (FireWithin)

_**I'm very exited to announce**_ that 
<a href="/history.html#v24_7" target="_blank">version 24.7</a>
of <a href="/" target="_blank">FireWithin</a> has added a 
<a href="/TheChosen.html#characters" target="_blank">Visual Character Guide</a>
to "The Chosen" page!  _To get a feel for this, check out the screen
shots (**below**)._


## At a Glance

If you're a fan of [*The Chosen*](https://thechosen.tv/), you know how
rich and layered the series is - both spiritually and narratively. To
make it easier to navigate all the supporting content, I’ve put
together a dedicated 
<a href="/TheChosen.html" target="_blank"><b>Chosen Resources Page</b></a>,
part of my
<b><a href="/" target="_blank">FireWithin</a></b> Bible Study Blog.

This page consolidates episode links, commentary, study materials, and
more - all in one place.

Below are a few annotated screenshots to highlight what’s available.

- [Visual Character Guide](#🎭-visual-character-guide)
- [Consolidated Resource Links](#📚-consolidated-resource-links)
- [Descriptions](#📝-descriptions)
- [Final Note](#✅-final-note)


## 🎭 Visual Character Guide

With so many characters in *The Chosen*, it can be easy to lose track.  

The latest release of this page promotes a 
<a href="/TheChosen.html#characters" target="_blank">Visual Guide</a>
that highlights the key players _**(50+ and counting)**_ to help you follow
the story as it unfolds.
