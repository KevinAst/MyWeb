# Jeremiah

God and Israel's relationship began like a marriage. God vowed to be
faithful, and Israel promised to be lovingly his. But Israel
repeatedly broke her marriage vows. She sacrificed to false gods; she
even killed her own children in their rituals. Jeremiah called Israel
a whore for this idolatry. When Israel worshiped other gods she was
really committing adultery and Jeremiah begged for her to return and
repent.

But Israel wouldn't listen, she chose to break her vows and her
covenant with God. But God promised that he would be a faithful
husband to his adulterous bride. In Jesus, he would begin a new
covenant that would transform his people from adulterous whores and
make them virgin brides once again.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Jeremiah Introduction**

> The prophet Jeremiah spoke to the kingdom of Judah for forty
> years—from the end of the Assyrian period until Judah was destroyed by
> Babylon. The book mixes sermons, prophetic oracles, and biographical
> narratives of Jeremiah’s experiences during the last years of the
> Judean kingdom. We are given an intimate look into the prophet’s own
> heart as he brings God’s message to his fellow Judeans, who reject him
> and even conspire to kill him.
> 
> The book begins and ends with historical references to the event
> Jeremiah was best known for predicting: the fall of Jerusalem. The
> four main parts generally consist (in order) of oracles, narratives
> (two sections), and then oracles. Significantly, each of these four
> parts ends with a reference to Jeremiah’s words being written in a
> book or scroll. A long poetic oracle is inserted in the middle
> narrative of the book. So Jeremiah’s prophecies appear at the
> beginning, middle and end of the book, highlighting their
> importance. The middle oracle, promising a new covenant designed to
> change the human heart, is shown to be the most important of all. God
> will do more than simply punish evil—he will overcome it with good.
> 
> The book of Jeremiah carries us back and forth in place and time as we
> turn its pages, yet its themes are consistent. The message of judgment
> for wrongdoing is followed by the restorative power of forgiveness and
> new life: to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build
> and to plant.
