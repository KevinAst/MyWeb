# Esther

In the book of Esther, God is never mentioned, named, or prayed
to. But despite this fact, God is always working to turn the plans of
the enemy upside down. God's people are enslaved to the Persian Empire
and under threat from its genocidal Prime Minister, Haman. Israel's
best hope is in the relatively powerless Esther and Mordecai. But God
uses these powerless people to turn back the plans of the
powerful. Ultimately, Esther reveals to us the Savior who not only
became powerless but died and turned even the power of the grave
upside down.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Esther Introduction**

> The book of Esther explains why Jews in the Persian period began
> celebrating a new festival called Purim. The law of Moses had earlier
> described how God’s mighty acts of deliverance lay behind holidays
> such as Passover and Tabernacles. The book of Esther shows how God
> intervened once again to save the Jews, leading to a commemoration of
> this great rescue in the feast of Purim.
> 
> This fast-moving story occurs during the reign of the Persian king
> Xerxes (most likely Xerxes I, 486–465 BC). It relates the adventures
> that take place when a Jewish exile named Esther and her cousin and
> guardian Mordecai work to rescue their people from a plot to destroy
> them. While the story never mentions God by name, God’s hand of
> protection can be detected in the timing and combination of events as
> they unfold.
> 
> The book features numerous banquets, including two hosted by Xerxes at
> the beginning, two given by Esther in the middle, and two celebrated
> by the grateful Jews at the end. Since this story was told to later
> generations during the feast of Purim itself, the audience is placed
> right in the middle of the action. Those who read it can not only join
> in celebrating God’s deliverance, they can ask themselves, as Mordecai
> asked Esther, for what great purpose God may have brought them to
> their own position in life.
