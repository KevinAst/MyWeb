# Mark

The author of Mark, John Mark, wrote this book based on the apostle
Peter’s memories of Jesus’ words and deeds.

The Gospel of Mark seeks to answer the question, "How can Jesus' death
be good news?" In the aftermath of Jesus' crucifixion, people were
wondering how Jesus could have been the promised Messiah if he died on
a cross. Mark answers this question by showing how everything Jesus
did in his life prepares us for and informs us about his death.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Mark Introduction**

> Mark appears to be written for an audience in Rome. A Roman
> centurion’s declaration near the end of the book - Surely this man was
> the Son of God! - models the witness to Jesus this gospel calls for.
> 
> The opening half of this fast-moving drama keys on the question: Who
> do you say I am? An episode at the end of the first half shows Jesus
> healing a blind man in two stages, so that he slowly comes to see. In
> the same way the disciples have only gradually come to recognize who
> Jesus is. Then in a key moment in the story, between its two halves,
> Peter confesses that Jesus is the Messiah.
> 
> Now the conflict moves out into the open. Jesus has come to introduce
> a radical new way of life that will undercut existing power
> relationships. The second half of the drama depicts this in three
> acts:
> 
> 1. Jesus and his disciples travel to Jerusalem.
> 
> 2. Jesus teaches in the temple and clashes with the
>    established leadership.
> 
> 3. In the final act, that leadership executes its plan and has
>    Jesus arrested and crucified, seemingly overturning all he has
>    done. But then God overturns their deed and raises Jesus to
>    life. So Mark’s readers are called to be faithful to Jesus, even in
>    suffering, because this is how God continues to overturn the
>    existing order and establish the way of life that Jesus taught.
