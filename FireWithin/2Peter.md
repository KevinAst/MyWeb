# 2 Peter

2 Peter asks hard questions: _"If God is just, why does so much evil go
unpunished?"_ and _"Isn't Hell just hateful religion?"_ Peter answers
that while God's judgment is real and terrifying, that also means
justice is real and that one day there will be no evil left in the
world.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} 2 Peter Introduction**

> Around AD 65 the apostle Peter was imprisoned in Rome by the emperor
> Nero, and he realized that he would soon be executed. Since he was an
> eyewitness of the ministry of Jesus, he decided to write another
> letter to the believers he had written to before, confirming what they
> had been taught about Jesus. False teachers were proposing that, since
> Jesus hadn’t returned already, his return couldn’t be expected at
> all. Because they didn’t expect any future judgment, they were living
> immoral lives. (Peter likely learned about the threat of these
> teachers from a letter sent by Jude, a brother of Jesus, to warn
> believers against them. Peter’s letter echoes Jude’s, but in shorter
> form. See Jude.)
> 
> Peter answers the false teachers by stressing that he personally saw
> the glory and majesty of Jesus on the sacred mountain (see Mark
> 9:2-13). Everyone will see this glory when Jesus returns. In powerful
> imagery Peter describes the false teachers’ destructive effect on the
> community and the judgment that awaits them. In the final section of
> his letter, Peter explains that the Messiah’s return has been delayed
> because God wants everyone to repent. Our proper response is to live
> good lives filled with hope, since we are looking forward to a new
> heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells.
