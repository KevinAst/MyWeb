## Questions and Answers

{{book.CornerstoneChapel}} holds an annual Question and Answer Service
where Pastor Gary and sons _(Pastor Tyler and Pastor Austin)_ answer
the congregation's Bible questions!

**NOTE:** Unlike most FireWithin links, we use YouTube references on
this page, rather than Cornerstone links.  This allows us to
time-slice directly into individual questions.  For each session, you
have the choice of either starting from the beginning and watching all
the way through, or you can directly link into the desired question.

<!-- DEV NOTE: 

     Because of the large number of question, I wanted to utilize the same browser window for all questions.

     - I initially attempted to use HTML <a> tag links (where the target= directive is available):
       EX: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOKtCXUoK74&t=01h06m59s" target="CornerstoneQuestAns">Is Cremation Ok?</a>

     - This was my test progression:
       1. GitBook markdown auto reverts html <a> tags to target="_blank", ignoring any target= directives
       2. JavaScript hooks to force the target= directive is also ignored by modern browsers
          <script>
              document.querySelectorAll("a").forEach(link => {
                  link.setAttribute("target", "CornerstoneQuestAns");
              });
          </script>
       3. JavaScript hooks to use window.open() also DOES NOT WORK
          <script>
            document.querySelectorAll("a").forEach(link => {
                link.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
                    event.preventDefault();
                    window.open(link.href, "CornerstoneQuestAns"); // Open in the named window
                });
            });
          </script>

     SINCE NOTHING I TRIED (ABOVE) WORKS, I punted and went back to the plain markdown solution :-(
