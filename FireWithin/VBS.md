## Themes

********************************************************************************
### Orientation

- <mark>PREP</mark>: write Guide Names on the Board - write "main" memory verse


- <mark>6pm-6:10pm</mark>


- <mark>Welcome</mark> Welcome "Clue"!  We are so glad to see each one of you in this years VBS!
  * How many of you have been at our VBS in the past?
  * It is really exciting - we have almost 600 kids in our event this year!


- <mark>Clue</mark> This year we have a "game" theme - and our group is called "Clue"!

  * How many of you have played "Clue"?
  * YOU KNOW - that classic "Who done it game"
    ... _Colonel Mustard with the Candle Stick in the Dining Room_
  * It's a favorite of my grand kids


- <mark>Guides</mark> Well, this year the Clue group has 4 Guides _(I've written our names on the board)_

  * Introduce each, and MY NAME is "Mr. B."
  * Our job is to help out in any way we can
  * With the primary goal of getting you where you need to be for each event
    - those who have been with us before know that each activity is in a different location
    - the challenge is that we have 600 kids doing this at the same time
    - so it is important to stay with your group
    - we will be moving in a straight line (single file)
    - and we have a flag at the head of the group


- <mark>Memory Verses</mark> Like other years, we have a memory verse for you to work on.

  * when you feel like you are ready, you can find a Guide and recite it to them
  * and then you will be recognized in the worship rally, and get a prize _(a set of "dog tags" that you can wear the rest of the week)_!
  * OK something NEW this year is we also have "Bonus Memory Verses" _(one for each day)_.
    - just like the primary verse, you can recite it to your Guide.
    - for every bonus verse you memorize, your name will be added to a pot
      and at the end of the week there will be a drawing
    - so the more memory verses you do, the better your chances for an extra prize!

### Tue 6/6: Jesus is Trustworthy

**Context:** _Peter Walked to Jesus on the Water_<br/>
... [Matthew 14:22-33](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/MAT.14.22-33.CSB)<br/>

**Bonus Verse**:<br/>
"Do not fear, for I am with you; <br>
do not be afraid, for I am your God.  <br>
I will strengthen you;  <br>
I will help you;  <br>
I will hold on to you with my righteous right hand."
... [Isaiah 41:10](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/ISA.41.10.CSB)

**Cornerstone Teaching** [Sermon: Matthew 13:53-14:36](https://cornerstonechapel.net/teaching/20130605/)

- Typical Fishing Boat was 7' X 20'
- All the disciples were in the boat and a storm was raging
- Jesus appeared, walking on the water
- The disciples were very afraid
- Peter was the only disciple to step out and walk to Jesus
- His faith waivered and he started to sink
- <mark>Jesus rescued Peter</mark>
- IN John's account the boat was immediately transported to shore (another miracle)
- Other places where this miracle was recorded
  - [Matthew 14:22-33](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/MAT.14.22-33.CSB):
    This passage recounts the event when Jesus walks on
    water and Peter attempts to do the same but starts sinking. It begins
    with Jesus sending his disciples ahead of him in a boat while he goes
    up a mountain to pray. During the night, a storm arises, and Jesus
    comes toward them, walking on the water.
  - [Mark 6:45-52](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/MRK.6.45-52.CSB):
    This account is similar to the one in Matthew. It
    describes Jesus walking on the water and his disciples'
    reaction. Jesus gets into the boat with them, and the wind ceases.
  - [John 6:16-21](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/JHN.6.16-21.CSB):
    This passage also tells the story of Jesus walking on
    water after the feeding of the five thousand. The disciples get into a
    boat and Jesus joins them by walking on the sea. They reach the other
    side of the sea safely.


********************************************************************************
### Wed 6/7: Jesus is Forgiving

**Context:** _Peter Denied Jesus and was Restored_<br/>
... [Luke 22:31-34](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/LUK.22.31-34.CSB) [54-62](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/LUK.22.54-62.CSB)<br/>
... [John 18:15-18](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/JHN.18.15-18.CSB) [21:1-19](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/JHN.21.1-19.CSB)<br/>

### Thu 6/8: Jesus is Worth Following

**Context:** _Peter spoke boldly about Jesus_<br/>
... [Acts 3:1 - 4:24](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/ACT.3.CSB) <br/>

**Bonus Verse**:<br/>
"There is salvation in no one else,  for there is no other name under heaven given to people by which we must be saved."
... [Acts 4:12](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/ACT.4.12.CSB)

**Cornerstone Teaching** [Sermon: Acts 4](https://cornerstonechapel.net/teaching/20151209/)

- Many thousands of people believed in the the gospel message of the
  life, death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus!
- Salvation through Jesus alone is an exclusive claim win an inclusive aim!
  **It is not narrowminded, because it is available to all!**
- God is not looking for the most polished, best educated, He is looking
  for people who are surrendered to Him.



********************************************************************************
### Fri 6/9: Jesus is for Everyone

<mark>INCLUDING Me</mark> _(not just the Jews)_

**Context:** _Peter told Cornelius About Jesus_<br/>
... [Acts 10](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/ACT.10.CSB)<br/>

**Bonus Verse**:<br/>
"All the prophets testify about him that through his name everyone who
believes in him receives forgiveness of sins."
... [Acts 10:43](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/ACT.10.43.CSB)<br/>

**Cornerstone Teaching** [Sermon: Acts 10](https://cornerstonechapel.net/teaching/20160203)

- Cornelius
  * was a Gentile
  * was a Roman centurion
  * was devout and God-fearing
  * he gave generously
  * he prayed regularly
  * even though he was devout, he <mark>still needed Jesus</mark>
- Peter and Simon
  * Peter was staying at the home of a Jewish man named Simon, which
    was very unusual because of his profession as a Jew.
  * It’s worth noting that as a tanner, Simon had to be in contact with dead
    animals, which was strictly forbidden for godly Jews.
  * Simon the tanner would have been considered unclean, and, therefore,
    he had to live outside of town.
  * Pastor Gary said, “There are some things that we do because it’s simply
    tradition. … Tradition would have taught Peter [that he should never go
    near much less into the house of an unclean person! Peter didn’t seem
    to be concerned with traditions that weren’t in the Scriptures.] There’s
    a lot of traditions that we embrace, and we believe and that we think
    are right, and they may not be biblical. [Peter was] going to have his
    heart stretched [to] accept something or someone or a group of
    people who up until this point, he would never have accepted.” 
- Peter and Cornelius
  * Peter rejected Cornelius’ “worshipful” greeting.
  * Peter shared a simple message about the life, death, and resurrection of
    Jesus.
  * Everyone in Cornelius’ household heard, received, and believed the truth
    about Jesus, and they were saved.
  * The Holy Spirit came in response to their faith in Jesus, and they were
    baptized in the Spirit.

  // explicitly invoke our page setup here
  // - believe this is executed after all DOM elms (above) are up-and-running)
  // - was having difficulty with following:
  //      window.addEventListener('load', pageSetup());
  //      * it was in fact executed EACH time the page is loaded
  //      * HOWEVER the 'onload' event fired ONLY ONCE (not in navigating to other page and back)
  //        - this must have something to do with how GITBOOK does it's navigation
  //          ... not really sure

  // handles BOTH registerImgClickFullScreenHandlers() & initializeCompletedChecks()
