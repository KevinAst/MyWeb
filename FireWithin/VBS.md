### Tue 6/6: Jesus is Trustworthy

**Context:** _Peter Walked to Jesus on the Water_<br/>
... [Matthew 14:22-33](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/MAT.14.22-33.CSB)<br/>

**Bonus Verse**:<br/>
"Do not fear, for I am with you; <br>
do not be afraid, for I am your God.  <br>
I will strengthen you;  <br>
I will help you;  <br>
I will hold on to you with my righteous right hand."
... [Isaiah 41:10](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/ISA.41.10.CSB)

**Cornerstone Teaching** [Matthew 13:53-14:36](https://cornerstonechapel.net/teaching/20130605/)

- Typical Fishing Boat was 7' X 20'
- All the disciples were in the boat and a storm was raging
- Jesus appeared, walking on the water
- The disciples were very afraid
- Peter was the only disciple to step out and walk to Jesus
- His faith waivered and he started to sink
- <mark>Jesus rescued Peter</mark>
- IN John's account the boat was immediately transported to shore (another miracle)
- Other places where this miracle was recorded
  - [Matthew 14:22-33](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/MAT.14.22-33.CSB):
    This passage recounts the event when Jesus walks on
    water and Peter attempts to do the same but starts sinking. It begins
    with Jesus sending his disciples ahead of him in a boat while he goes
    up a mountain to pray. During the night, a storm arises, and Jesus
    comes toward them, walking on the water.
  - [Mark 6:45-52](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/MRK.6.45-52.CSB):
    This account is similar to the one in Matthew. It
    describes Jesus walking on the water and his disciples'
    reaction. Jesus gets into the boat with them, and the wind ceases.
  - [John 6:16-21](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/JHN.6.16-21.CSB):
    This passage also tells the story of Jesus walking on
    water after the feeding of the five thousand. The disciples get into a
    boat and Jesus joins them by walking on the sea. They reach the other
    side of the sea safely.


********************************************************************************
### Wed 6/7: Jesus is Forgiving

**Context:** _Peter Denied Jesus and was Restored_<br/>
... [Luke 22:31-34](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/LUK.22.31-34.CSB) [54-62](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/LUK.22.54-62.CSB)<br/>
... [John 18:15-18](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/JHN.18.15-18.CSB) [21:1-19](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/JHN.21.1-19.CSB)<br/>

### Fri 6/9: Jesus is for Everyone

<mark>INCLUDING Me</mark> _(not just the Jews)_

**Context:** _Peter told Cornelius About Jesus_<br/>
... [Acts 10](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/ACT.10.CSB)<br/>

**Bonus Verse**:<br/>
"All the prophets testify about him that through his name everyone who
believes in him receives forgiveness of sins."
... [Acts 10:43](https://www.bible.com/bible/1713/ACT.10.43.CSB)<br/>

**Cornerstone Teaching** [Acts 10](https://cornerstonechapel.net/teaching/20160203)

- Cornelius
  * was a Gentile
  * was a Roman centurion
  * was devout and God-fearing
  * he gave generously
  * he prayed regularly
  * even though he was devout, he <mark>still needed Jesus</mark>
- Peter and Simon
  * Peter was staying at the home of a Jewish man named Simon, which
    was very unusual because of his profession as a Jew.
  * It’s worth noting that as a tanner, Simon had to be in contact with dead
    animals, which was strictly forbidden for godly Jews.
  * Simon the tanner would have been considered unclean, and, therefore,
    he had to live outside of town.
  * Pastor Gary said, “There are some things that we do because it’s simply
    tradition. … Tradition would have taught Peter [that he should never go
    near much less into the house of an unclean person! Peter didn’t seem
    to be concerned with traditions that weren’t in the Scriptures.] There’s
    a lot of traditions that we embrace, and we believe and that we think
    are right, and they may not be biblical. [Peter was] going to have his
    heart stretched [to] accept something or someone or a group of
    people who up until this point, he would never have accepted.” 
- Peter and Cornelius
  * Peter rejected Cornelius’ “worshipful” greeting.
  * Peter shared a simple message about the life, death, and resurrection of
    Jesus.
  * Everyone in Cornelius’ household heard, received, and believed the truth
    about Jesus, and they were saved.
  * The Holy Spirit came in response to their faith in Jesus, and they were
    baptized in the Spirit.
