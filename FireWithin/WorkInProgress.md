# Work In Progress

You may have noticed that this site is a work-in-progress.

At the time of this writing I have compiled only a small number of
books in the Bible.  This represents the books that I have, or am
currently studying _(since my renewed faith)_.

You are welcome to try one of these existing studies ... **just click
on the desired book (in the Left Nav Bar)**.  I will be adding more as
I continue my study.

> If there is a specific book you are wanting to study _(ahead of my
> schedule)_, I would be happy to compile those resources _(it takes
> me roughly 2 hours per book)_.  Please reach out to me and I will be
> glad to add an "early release" of that book :-)
