# Haggai

The people of Israel were conquered by Babylon because they broke
their covenant with God through idolatry and injustice. The book of
Haggai was written 70 years after this prophesied exile and recounts
the experience of a small group of Israelites, led by Joshua and
Zerubbabel, who returned to rebuild Jerusalem.

The recently returned exiles face hardship in their rebuilding efforts
and struggle to remain faithful after so much loss and
disappointment. Haggai assures the people that their efforts and
faithfulness will be blessed. God will one day build a new Jerusalem
and live amidst his people.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Haggai Introduction**

> When Cyrus, king of Persia, conquered Babylon in 539 BC, he allowed
> the exiled Jews to return home and rebuild the temple in
> Jerusalem. One group returned the next year, completing and dedicating
> the temple foundation within two more years. But they were stopped by
> suspicious and resentful neighbors who had influence in the Persian
> court (see Ezra 4:4–6:22). Sixteen years later, when King Darius takes
> the throne, the prophet Haggai urges the people to restart their
> work. He calls specifically on Zerubbabel, the appointed governor, and
> Joshua the high priest, to lead the project. Within four years the
> reconstruction was completed and worship in the temple resumed.
> 
> Haggai delivers his four messages during a strategic four-month period
> at the beginning of Darius’ reign. The first message explains that
> Israel’s crops aren’t being blessed because God’s house has been left
> in ruins. The second message gives encouragement to those who found
> the new temple disappointing compared to Solomon’s original
> temple. God promises that its glory will outshine the first
> temple. The third message assures the people that from now on their
> crops will be blessed. The final message is a personal encouragement
> to Zerubbabel himself, the heir to the throne of David. The people are
> back in their land, and so is God’s blessing.
