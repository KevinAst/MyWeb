# 1 Corinthians

1 Corinthians challenges believers to examine every area of life
through the lens of the Gospel. Specifically, Paul addresses divisions
among believers, food, sexual integrity, worship gatherings, and the
resurrection.

In 1 Corinthians, Paul applies the Gospel to the sin, conflicts, and
problems within the church at Corinth.  Many of these problems stemmed
from the Greek's views about wisdom, which informed many of their
moral and religious decisions. The Gospel of Jesus counteracts the
world's wisdom because Jesus' death did not look like wisdom to most
people. However, in this letter, Paul proves that Jesus going to the
cross is the wisest thing that has ever happened.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} 1 Corinthians Introduction**

> The book of Acts describes how Paul brought the royal news about Jesus
> the Messiah to Macedonia (northern Greece), but then had to flee to
> Achaia (southern Greece) for his own safety. He visited the city of
> Corinth there, a wealthy and cosmopolitan commercial center. Many
> people became believers, so he stayed for a year and a half to teach
> them.
> 
> After he left, the Corinthians wrote to Paul (in a letter we no longer
> have) with some key questions. The Corinthians had adopted the common
> Greek idea that physical things are bad, so they wanted to free the
> human spirit from the body. This affected the way they saw such things
> as marriage, attendance at ceremonial meals for pagan gods, and even
> the resurrection of Jesus. In the letter we know as 1 Corinthians Paul
> addresses all of these concerns, as well as questions about worship.
> 
> Paul writes that this world in its present form is passing away,but
> the Corinthians can give themselves fully to the work of the Lord
> since their labor in the Lord is not in vain. The coming resurrection
> of the dead, and the new world that will accompany it, will show the
> value of all their current efforts. Paul’s practical advice for how to
> consistently embody the new life of God’s kingdom during a particular
> scene in the biblical drama gives us great insight as we seek to take
> up our roles today.
