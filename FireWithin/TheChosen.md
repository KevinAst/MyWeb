## Overview

- **What is it?** ... _from [The Chosen](https://thechosen.tv/) site:_

  The Chosen is a historical drama based on the life of Jesus Christ,
  seen through the eyes of those who knew him. Set against the backdrop
  of Roman oppression in first-century Israel, the seven-season show
  shares an authentic and intimate look at Jesus’ revolutionary life and
  teachings.

  The Chosen is based on the true stories of the Gospels of Jesus
  Christ. Some locations and timelines have been combined or
  condensed. Backstories and some characters or dialog have been added.

  However, all the bible and historical context and any artistic
  imagination are designed to support the truth and intention of the
  Scriptures. Viewers are encouraged to read the scripture and the
  Gospels.

- **It's Free!**

  The Chosen uses a "crowdfunding" approach, so it's completely free
  to watch.  They utilize a "Pay it Forward" model, so you can
  contribute if you wish, offsetting some of their costs, keeping
  the show free.

  From the onset of Season 2, they will pre-release a new season in
  theaters for a short time.  After that, they will make the new
  season available through their free app.

- **Is it for me?**

  <!-- https://www.gotquestions.org/The-Chosen.html -->

  Watching **The Chosen** is a matter of conscience.  Some Christians
  appreciate the retelling of Jesus’ life, while others have
  difficulty with the artistic license involved with portraying Jesus’
  life on film _(and that's OK)_.

  I personally fall in the former camp.  This is not like any other
  "religious program" you have seen before.  It simply brings the
  biblical characters to life, and you realize they had many of the same
  experiences and struggles that we do today.

  I would encourage you to prayerfully discern whether watching the show
  will be a benefit or a hindrance to your walk with the Lord.

- **Why I created this page**

  This page was created to have a concise and consolidated set of links
  to the various _(somewhat disjointed)_ resources (i.e. the **streaming
  service**, **deep dives**, and **devotions**).
  
  Consistent with all **"Fire Within"** studies, you have the
  "completion status" check boxes - to help keep track of where you are
  at in the series.

## Usage

- **Install the Apps?**
  
  When you have installed the appropriate applications (i.e. "The
  Chosen App", or the "YouVersion Bible App"), the links below will be
  serviced by the app itself.  If you have NOT installed these apps,
  the links will be serviced by your browser.
  
  Either way works.  Typically it is recommended to install the apps
  _(it's really your preference)_.
  
- **Casting**
  
  Even though you are streaming an episode from your mobile device,
  you can cast it to your SmartTV, allowing everyone to enjoy it
  together.

  Here are some instructions that walk you through the process:
  [How to cast to your TV?](https://support.angel.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410287250327-How-to-cast-to-your-TV)
  
- **Descriptions**
  
  Descriptions have been compiled for both the series, and each
  episode.  However, because of limited space, these descriptions
  **are hidden by default**.
  
  You can toggle their display by simply clicking the **"Show
  Descriptions"** button (at the top of each series).
  
- **Deep Dives**

  Brandon and Vanessa Snipe are worship leaders that have a popular
  YouTube channel, where they discuss **The Chosen** in detail,
  bringing scripture into the discussion.  They started out with [The
  Snipe Life](https://www.youtube.com/@TheSnipeLife) which
  subsequently became [The Chosen
  Sleuth](https://www.youtube.com/@TheChosenSleuth) three years later.
  They have a ton of video content, which like many YouTube channels
  lack some organizational structure.

  The videos that discuss each Chosen episode have been linked
  directly in the episode guide (prefixed with `DD: {desc}`
  ... i.e. Deep Dive).
  
- **Devotions**
  
  The devotions listed here are provided by "The Chosen" team.
  
  There is not a devotion for every episode _(not quite sure why that
  is)_.  If an episode does not have a devotion, that slot is blank.
  
  The scripture references for each episode, come from the devotion.
  
  To Run a Devotion: **long-press** the `Devo-x` link, and click the
  "**open in browser**" option.
  
  - _Background:_
  
    Normally, you must subscribe to a Bible Reading Plan, in order to
    use it.  This allows the Bible App to track your progress.
    The devotion links, provided below, are generic - in that they do
    NOT contain any of your account subscription information.  This
    works when running in a browser, however, when clicked on a mobile
    device, it is serviced by your installed Bible App, and generates an
    error, stating: "**No reading plan content**".
  
    To work around this, simply **long-press** the `Devo-x` link, and
    click the "**open in browser**" option.


## Season 1 

P{ inject('<div data-fw-desc style="display: none;">') }P

Season 1 is set in 1st century Galilee, where Jesus starts to build a
group for his ministry, inviting several people with different
backgrounds.

As he performs his first miracles, Jesus calls the redeemed woman Mary
Magdalene; the stonemason Thaddeus; the choir member Little James; the
fishermen Simon, Andrew, Big James, and John; the caterer Thomas and
vintner Ramah; and the tax collector Matthew to follow him.

As the group travels through Samaria and following his meeting with
Nicodemus, Jesus launches his public ministry after revealing himself
to Photina, a Samaritan woman.

## Season 2

P{ inject('<div data-fw-desc style="display: none;">') }P

Beginning in Samaria, Season 2 moves into nearby regions such as Syria
and Judea, where Jesus continues to build his group of students.

As He continues to perform miracles while preparing for an important
sermon, Jesus additionally calls John the Baptizer's disciple Philip,
the architect Nathanael, and the Zealot Simon Z.

As word of Jesus continues to spread throughout the region, He
encounters both opportunities and difficulties.

The season culminates with preparations being made for the Sermon on
the Mount, with the help of the business apprentice Judas Iscariot.

## Season 3

P{ inject('<div data-fw-desc style="display: none;">') }P

“Come to me, you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you
rest.” 
Season 3 picks up where Season 2 left off, with Jesus delivering
the most famous sermon in history.
What follows are the consequences of living out his teachings. The
world changes because of this sermon, and the believers in (and
enemies of) Jesus increase exponentially. 

Following the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus sends his twelve apostles,
two by two, to preach and perform miracles without him, leading to the
disciples facing their biggest challenge yet.

Jesus then returns to his hometown, Nazareth, which results in a shift
to his ministry at the year of his popularity.

At the climactic end of the season in the Decapolis and at the Sea of
Galilee, Jesus feeds thousands with loaves and fishes and then walks
on the water.

<!-- Description found here: https://www.thechosenriseup.com/  -->

Clashing kingdoms. Rival rulers. The enemies of Jesus close in while
His followers struggle to keep up, leaving him to carry the burden
alone.

Threatened by the reality of Jesus’ growing influence, religious
leaders do the unthinkable — ally with their Roman oppressors. As the
seeds of betrayal are planted and opposition to Jesus’ message turns
violent, he’s left with no alternative but demand his followers RISE
UP.
