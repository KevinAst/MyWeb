## Usage

**Install the Apps?**

- When you have installed the appropriate applications (i.e. "The
  Chosen App", or the "YouVersion Bible App"), the links below will be
  serviced by the app itself.  If you have NOT installed these apps,
  the links will be serviced by your browser.

  Either way works.  Typically it is recommended to install the apps
  _(it's really your preference)_.


**Descriptions:**

- The descriptions have been compiled for both the series and each
  episode.  However, because of limited space, these descriptions
  are hidden by default.

  You can toggle their display by simply clicking the **"Show
  Descriptions"** button (at the top of each series).


**Devotions Notes:**

- For some reason there is NOT a devotion for every episode. ?? expand

- To Run a Devotion: **long-press** the `Devotion` link, and click the
  "**open in browser**" option.

  _Background:_

  Normally, you must subscribe to a Bible Reading Plan, in order to
  use it.  This allows the Bible App to track your progress.
  The devotion links, provided below, are generic - in that they do
  NOT contain any of your account subscription information.  This
  works when running in a browser, however, when clicked on a mobile
  device, it is serviced by your installed Bible App, and generates an
  error, stating: "**No reading plan content**".

  To work around this, simply **long-press** the `Devotion` link, and
  click the "**open in browser**" option.


## Season 1 

P{ inject('<div data-fw-desc style="display: none;">') }P

Season 1 is set in 1st century Galilee, where Jesus starts to build a
group for his ministry, inviting several people with different
backgrounds.

As he performs his first miracles, Jesus calls the redeemed woman Mary
Magdalene; the stonemason Thaddeus; the choir member Little James; the
fishermen Simon, Andrew, Big James, and John; the caterer Thomas and
vintner Ramah; and the tax collector Matthew to follow him.

As the group travels through Samaria and following his meeting with
Nicodemus, Jesus launches his public ministry after revealing himself
to Photina, a Samaritan woman.

## Season 2

P{ inject('<div data-fw-desc style="display: none;">') }P

Beginning in Samaria, Season 2 moves into nearby regions such as Syria
and Judea, where Jesus continues to build his group of students.

As He continues to perform miracles while preparing for an important
sermon, Jesus additionally calls John the Baptizer's disciple Philip,
the architect Nathanael, and the Zealot Simon Z.

As word of Jesus continues to spread throughout the region, He
encounters both opportunities and difficulties.

The season culminates with preparations being made for the Sermon on
the Mount, with the help of the business apprentice Judas Iscariot.

## Season 3

P{ inject('<div data-fw-desc style="display: none;">') }P

“Come to me, you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you
rest.” 
Season 3 picks up where Season 2 left off, with Jesus delivering
the most famous sermon in history.
What follows are the consequences of living out his teachings. The
world changes because of this sermon, and the believers in (and
enemies of) Jesus increase exponentially. 

Following the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus sends his twelve apostles,
two by two, to preach and perform miracles without him, leading to the
disciples facing their biggest challenge yet.

Jesus then returns to his hometown, Nazareth, which results in a shift
to his ministry at the year of his popularity.

At the climactic end of the season in the Decapolis and at the Sea of
Galilee, Jesus feeds thousands with loaves and fishes and then walks
on the water.
