### The Bible App

How do **you** use the
[Bible App](https://www.bible.com/)
_(by [YouVersion](https://www.youversion.com/))_?

For me, the Bible App has transformed the way I interact with God’s Word:
- referencing passages in my [Fire Within](https://wiibridges.com/FireWithin/) Bible Study blog
- comparing multiple translations at a touch
- having my Bible wherever I go
- etc., etc., etc.

Whether or not you use the Bible App, there is no denying that it has
opened the door for billions to access God’s Word like never before.

### The Milestone

In November of 2025, a major milestone was achieved: **One Billion
Installs of the Bible App!** YouVersion **celebrated this
milestone with a [live stream event](https://www.bible.com/billion).**

I wasn’t sure I would watch at first, but I decided to join at the
last minute, and **it quickly became one of the most inspiring and
memorable worship experience I’ve seen in years**.


### The Focus

While technology made this achievement possible _(just as the printing
press did in the late 1400s)_, the focus of this event was NOT
technology.  Rather it was **a celebration of the Living Word of God
that is active and powerful and never returns void!**

- _**a billion opportunities to experience the Word made flesh**_

- _**a billion opportunities for God to draw near to someone who is
  hurting or searching - that needs saving from brokenness and sin**_

The event took place at Oklahoma City’s [Paycom
Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paycom_Center), packed with
18,000 attendees, plus millions watching online worldwide. This was a
historic celebration of the Bible through worship and storytelling.

### The People

There were **many worship leaders present**, like **Phil Wickham**
_(This Is Our God)_, **Cece Winans** _(Goodness of God)_, **Brooke
Ligertwood** _(What a Beautiful Name)_, **Lauren Daigle** _(Let It Be
A Hallelujah)_, just to name a few.

**Dallas Jenkins** (of [The Chosen](https://thechosen.tv/)) even made
an appearance!

If you ask me **who my favorite speaker was**, that would be difficult
to pinpoint _(there were so many inspiring speakers)_.  I have to say
however that **two stood out** _for me_:

- **[Christine Caine](https://christinecaine.com/)**

  Christine shared her testimony - a powerful recognition of how God
  can use even the most broken of us.

- **[Craig Groeschel](https://www.craiggroeschel.com/about)** _(of [Life.Church](https://www.life.church/) - the ministry behind YouVersion)_

  Craig gave an amazing testimony of how God's Word ALONE saved him
  through a Gideon New Testament in college.  When he came to
  M{ bibleLink(`eph.2.8-9@@Ephesians 2:8-9`) }M,
  _(by grace you have been saved, through faith - not
  by works - it is the gift of God)_, he surrendered his life to
  Christ!

  He went through a "rapid fire" progression of Gospel passages that
  was so logically crafted, I wrote them down:

  - M{ bibleLink(`isa.53.6@@Isaiah 53.6`) }M ... _we have ALL left God_
  - M{ bibleLink(`rom.3.23@@Romans 3:23`) }M ... _we have ALL sinned_
  - M{ bibleLink(`rom.6.23@@Romans 6:23`) }M ... _the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal_
  - M{ bibleLink(`rom.5.8@@Romans 5:8`) }M ... _God showed his love for us through Christ_
  - M{ bibleLink(`jhn.3.16@@John 3:16`) }M ... _God loved us so much He gave His Son_
  - M{ bibleLink(`1co.15.3-4@@1 Corinthians 15:3-4`) }M ... _Christ died for our sins and was raised on the third day_
  - M{ bibleLink(`rom.10.13@@Romans 10:14`) }M ... _all who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved_
