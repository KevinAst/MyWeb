# Psalms

The Psalms are songs for a people waiting in exile. They spring from
Israel's history, when people like King David wrote inspired songs
giving thanks, repenting of sin, affirming God's promises, or asking
for help. The Psalms have been a source of hope, a guide for honest
prayer, and a treasury of prophetic promises for God's people
throughout generations. Now, Jesus has fulfilled these Psalms and
given them to his church, providing us with songs to sing while we
wait in this earthly exile for his return.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Psalms Introduction**

> The book of Psalms is a collection of song lyrics. Like many songs,
> they were first written in response to events in the lives of their
> authors. Later, the whole community used them in worship. When Israel
> returned from exile in Babylon many of the songs from over the
> centuries were collected in the book of Psalms.
> 
> The book is structured into five parts marked off by the phrase,
> Praise be to the Lord… Amen and Amen!These five “books” remind the
> reader of the five books of Moses. Like the law, these song lyrics can
> be read and studied for instruction. Psalm 1 emphasizes such
> meditation and seems to have been placed first to make this point.
> 
> The five books also tell a three-part story of Israel’s redemption:
> monarchy, exile and return. The psalms of King David dominate books
> one and two. The beginning and ending of book three highlight Israel’s
> exile. The fourth book ends with a plea that God bring the exiled
> people home. The fifth book declares that God has done just that. Now
> the reason for the group of praise psalms at the end of the book is
> apparent: God has been faithful, judging Israel in exile but then
> bringing the nation home again.
> 
> The book of Psalms thus operates at two levels: individually the songs
> explore a wide variety of honest spiritual responses to God, while the
> overall collection tells, and celebrates, the work of God in history
> to save his people.
