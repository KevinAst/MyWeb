# Job

Why does God allow us to suffer? Why do bad things happen to good
people? What is the relationship between God, suffering, and sin?
These are some of the most difficult questions raised about and
against Christianity.

The book of Job takes them head-on but may not give us the answers we
want. The majority of Job shows us so many of the wrong ways to
explain why we suffer and what God's role is in it. The main answer
Job does provide is that, in suffering, God is doing something beyond
what our minds and logic can grasp. While we cannot get all the
answers we want to why we suffer, Job tells us that God is worth
trusting through it.

Ultimately, Job points us to Jesus. Job's friends tried to blame Job
for suffering, while Job eventually ends up blaming God. Neither
solutions are correct. Nevertheless, even though we are to blame for
much of the suffering we and others experience because of our sin,
Jesus takes the blame for it on the cross. Jesus suffered, taking the
pain and blame our sins deserved, to show us that God is truly doing
something through suffering that we cannot comprehend. He saved the
world by suffering on the cross.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Job Introduction**

> The wisdom of Proverbs describes how godly character generally leads
> to success. Ecclesiastes tempers this, warning that rewards are not
> guaranteed, since a kind of “crookedness” has come into our world. The
> book of Job goes further, exploring how righteous people sometimes
> suffer. The book of Job uses a common literary device from the wisdom
> traditions of the ancient world: an extended conversation based on
> poetic speeches.
> 
> Job is introduced as a good man. But “the adversary” (satan in Hebrew)
> points out an apparent problem in God’s moral oversight of the
> universe. If goodness is always rewarded, how can we know if it’s born
> from love of God or desire for gain? So God allows the adversary to
> bring suffering into Job’s life.
> 
> Job doesn’t curse God as the adversary predicted but ends up debating
> with three friends: Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar. Their overly rigid
> view of the moral universe convinces them that Job’s own wrongdoing
> has caused his suffering. A young man Elihu joins the conversation
> later, while Job continues to insist that he has done nothing wrong
> and deserves a hearing before God.
> 
> Finally, God reveals the power and wisdom shown in his oversight of
> creation. Job then humbly admits his own limited understanding. When
> God rebukes Job’s three friends, we see they are guilty of a far worse
> assumption than Job. In the end God blesses Job with twice as much as
> he had before. The book warns us to avoid reducing God’s moral rule to
> easy formulas.
