# Habakkuk

In the book of Habakkuk God’s prophet asks why God tolerates evil and
why he seems slow in punishing injustice. God responds that he has a
plan to judge all evil thoroughly and finally. But God also says that
Habakkuk must learn to endure his current sufferings and trust his
God.

Ultimately, God’s answer to the problem of evil begins to be answered
in the death of Jesus. In Jesus God endured suffering, trusted his
God, and was ultimately raised from the dead. Habakkuk shows us that
because of Jesus we know that God will judge evil and rescue his
people.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Habakkuk Introduction**

> Near the time of the transition from the Assyrian to the Babylonian
> empires (late 7th century BC), the prophet Habakkuk engaged in a
> profound dialogue with Israel’s God. The form of his book is a short
> series of complaints, or laments, followed by the divine
> responses. When Habakkuk’s cries are answered, he closes with a hymn
> of confidence in God’s expected victory.
> 
> The prophet begins by asking how long God will allow evil to
> triumph. The divine reply is that God is raising up the Babylonians as
> his tool of correction. This leads to Habakkuk’s second question: Why
> do you allow the wicked to swallow up those more righteous than
> themselves? God replies again, explaining that the Babylonians will be
> judged just like the Assyrians, and that the righteous must await this
> in faith and patience. The inevitability of Babylon’s doom is
> emphasized when God pronounces a series of five woes against it.
> 
> When Habakkuk’s dialogue with God concludes, the book moves to what is
> called A prayer of Habakkuk. But its musical notations reveal that it
> is clearly meant to be sung. Habakkuk celebrates God’s dramatic
> intervention for Israel in the past and prays that God will do it
> again. The prophet resolves in the meantime to wait patiently for
> God’s coming.
