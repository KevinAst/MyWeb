<h1 id="fire-within">Fire Within</h1>
<p><img class="diagram" src="FireWithinLogo4.jpg" alt="Fire Within" width="150px" align="right"> <!-- NOTE: align allows text to flow around image :-) --></p>
<p>Speaking of a &quot;Fire Within&quot;, I thought this would be a good
opportunity to share a little bit about my faith in Christ.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-christian">What does it mean to be a Christian?</h2>
<p>I suspect that many people have a misconception of what it means to be
a Christian.  They look at it as a process of &quot;pulling yourself up by
your bootstraps&quot; ... to live a good enough life to be accepted into
Heaven by God.  I can appreciate this concept because this is what all
other religions strive for.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is nothing could be further from the truth.
It is not possible for us to work our way into heaven with our &quot;good
works&quot;.  The Bible tells us that our righteousness is like filthy rags
before God <em>(<a href="https://bible.com/bible/isa.64.6.niv" target="_blank">Isaiah 64:6</a>)</em>.</p>
<h2 id="god-is-holy">God is Holy</h2>
<p>In reality, there is a deep chasm between us and the Holy God.  It is
difficult to even comprehend how Holy our God is.  What separates us
from God is our sinful nature, and there is nothing we can do <em>in and
of ourselves</em> to bridge that gap.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-beginning">In the Beginning</h2>
<p>It wasn&apos;t always this way.  When God created the world, we had a pure
relationship with Him <em>(in Adam and Eve)</em>.  However, God gave us free
will, and Adam and Eve chose to disobey God <em>(and so by inference -
us)</em>.  Hence ushered in the severing of our relationship with God.</p>
<p>From that very moment in time, God formulated a plan to bring us back
into His fold.</p>
<h2 id="am-i-good-enough">Am I good enough?</h2>
<p>You might be saying, well I&apos;m a pretty good person ... I look out for
others ... I&apos;m not a cheat or a thief ... etc.  Those are all good
things, but it doesn&apos;t come close to the standard of a Holy God.
Jesus reveals that even what we think in our minds can be a sin
<a href="https://bible.com/bible/mat.5.28.niv" target="_blank">Matthew 5:28</a></p>
<h2 id="the-gospel">The Gospel</h2>
<p>The Gospel is the Good News that salvation is God&apos;s free gift to us,
but we must accept it
<em>(<a href="https://bible.com/bible/jhn.14.6.niv" target="_blank">John 14:6</a>
<a href="https://bible.com/bible/rom.10.9-10.niv" target="_blank">Romans 10:9-10</a>)</em>.</p>
<p>God requires a sacrifice for the atonement of our sins.  This is what
the Old Testament sacrificial system was <em>(a temporary one, which had
to be repeated)</em>.  In reality, this was simply a picture <em>(or a
foretelling)</em> of the ultimate sacrifice <em>(a permanent one)</em> ... that is
of Jesus Christ.  Jesus <em>(who is part of the triune God head - Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost)</em>, who always existed, humbled himself and came to
earth through a miraculous virgin birth.  He is both God and man.  He
lived a sinless perfect life.  His ministry modeled the true
relationship we can have with God.  He was sacrificed on a cross <em>(the
most brutal and shameful death imaginable)</em>, as a permanent atonement
for our sins.  He rose from the dead <em>(the first of many saints)</em>, and
ascended into heaven, where he prepares a place for his followers.</p>
<p>The bible tells us that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All have sinned
<a href="https://bible.com/bible/rom.3.10.niv" target="_blank">Romans 3:10</a>
<a href="https://bible.com/bible/rom.3.23.niv" target="_blank">Romans 3:23</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>The results of sin is death ... but we don&apos;t have to experience
death and hell, for God&apos;s gift to us is forgiveness and eternal life
in heaven with Him.
<a href="https://bible.com/bible/rom.6.23.niv" target="_blank">Romans 6:23</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>In order to receive this gift, you must believe that it is real and
that it can truly change your life. <em>This is more than a simple
&quot;head knowledge&quot;</em>.  It is an act of trusting Jesus with your heart,
and turning your life over to Him.
<a href="https://bible.com/bible/eph.2.8.niv" target="_blank">Ephesians 2:8</a>
You must confess Jesus as Lord.
<a href="https://bible.com/bible/rom.10.13.niv" target="_blank">Romans 10:13</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Salvation is a free gift of God, offered to all who simply ask.
<mark>If you want to become a Christian</mark>, you must fervently
believe in the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus, repent from your
sin, and ask him to come into and change your life.  <mark>You can
simply pray this prayer:</mark></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Jesus, I confess that I have sinned.
I repent of my sin and turn to you.
I believe that you died on the cross for me.
That you rose from the dead.
That you reign in heaven.
I confess you as my Lord, and my Savior.
I pledge my life to you from this day forward.
Fill me with your spirit, that I might be your servant.
Thank you for saving me.
In Jesus name.
Amen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth of the matter is Christianity is less about religion, and
more about a personal relationship with God.</p>
<p>If you prayed this prayer, there are angels rejoicing in heaven
<em>(<a href="https://bible.com/bible/luk.15.10.niv" target="_blank">Luke 15:10</a>)</em>!  This reveals
just how valuable you are to God and how much He desires for you to be
with Him in heaven forever!  A great victory has been won!  Your next
step is to seek out other believers, <em>in a local Bible believing
church</em>, that can assist and disciple you in your new found faith!</p>
<h2 id="my-faith">My Faith</h2>
<p>In my personal life, I made this profession of faith as a young boy,
during a revival of my parents church.</p>
<p>I was active in my church, trying to live a life that honored God.  I
continued that process into my adult days, raising my family and
continuing to be active in my church.</p>
<p>However, it seemed like I was missing something.  I would see other
Christians that were &quot;on fire&quot; for the Lord.  I didn&apos;t have the
passion to be in God&apos;s Word, and my prayer life was non-existent.  It
seemed like I was merely going through the motions.</p>
<p>In 2005 I actually fell away from the church <em>(for almost 15 years)</em>.
I felt even more distant from God, and sin increased in my life.</p>
<h2 id="a-renewed-faith">A Renewed Faith</h2>
<p>It was in 2020 when God started working in my heart.  The things in
this world seemed to be completely upside down ... pointing to an ever
increasing sinful nature of our society <em>(just as predicted in the end
times)</em>.</p>
<p>God laid on my heart that the difference between my past Christian
Life and the Christians that were &quot;On Fire&quot; for the Lord, was the
empowering of the Holy Spirit.  This world is complicated and it is
not something we can navigate on our own.  We need help.</p>
<p>I believe there are two distinct aspects of the Holy Spirit in a
believer&apos;s life:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Indwelling of the Holy Spirit.  This happens at the moment of
salvation, and is a one-time occurrence.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Empowering of the Holy Spirit <em>(or Baptism of the Spirit)</em>.  This is
when the Holy Spirit comes upon a person in power.  </p>
<p>This is separate and distinct from salvation, and can occur multiple
times in a believer&apos;s life.  There are examples in scripture where
one group of believers were empowered by the Holy Spirit multiple
times.  This is something that was missing in my faith, and it is
crucial in providing the guidance to navigate life&apos;s every day
twists and turns <em>(overcoming temptation and sin)</em>.</p>
<p>How does this happen, you might be wondering?  It&apos;s not difficult
at all.  It happens by simply asking God, and believing by faith.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>For a full explanation of this concept, please listen to
Pastor Gary Hamrick&apos;s <a href="https://cornerstonechapel.net/teaching/20151104/" target="_blank">Sermon in Acts 2:1-13</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I fervently asked the Holy Spirit to empower me and assist me in
my daily life, it was truly a miracle.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The past sins in my life were greatly diminished.  This was not an
insignificant thing ... my desire for long standing addictions were
simply removed ... Praise God!</p>
</li>
<li><p>For the first time I had a passion to be in God&apos;s word, soaking up
everything He has for me through his word.  This has manifest itself
in this Bible Study blog.</p>
</li>
<li><p>My prayer life is improving, but still needs work <em>(please pray for
me in this regard)</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have for the first time, a desire to share my faith with others.
If you think about it, this is the most crucial aspect of a
Christian&apos;s life, <em>and part of the Lord Jesus&apos; Great Commission</em>
<a href="https://bible.com/bible/mat.28.16-20.niv" target="_blank">Matthew 28:16-20</a>
... sharing the Good News to a lost world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&apos;m certainly not perfect.  I have and will have a long way to go in
solidifying my relationship with God.  But this is certainly a step in
the right direction, and I thank God for his provision!</p>
<h2 id="may-the-lord-bless-you">May the Lord Bless You</h2>
<p>I pray that if you do not know the Lord, you will consider what has
been presented here, and ask him to come into your life.</p>
<p>If you do know the Lord, I pray that God will bless you in your walk
with Christ.</p>
<p><em>Yours In Christ,</em>
