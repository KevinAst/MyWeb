# 2 John

In his letters, John encourages a congregation under attack by a group
of false teachers he calls antichrists. These antichrists are
preaching a message contrary to the Gospel and doing all they can to
sow discord and confusion. Through John's letters, we learn about the
Good News that Jesus has come in the flesh and why a simple Gospel is
the best antidote to the complexity, confusion, and discord sown
around us.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} 2 John Introduction**

> The same person who wrote 1 John to encourage believers also found it
> necessary to write to other churches where the false teachers might go
> to spread their ideas and practices. The letter of 2 John addresses
> one such gathering, referring to the church as a lady and its members
> as her children. The author describes the members of his own community
> as the children of your sister. (This was apparently typical of early
> followers of Jesus; there is a similar greeting at the end of 1
> Peter.) He identifies himself as a church leader by using the title
> elder.
> 
> Apparently some people from this church had just come to visit him and
> he was pleased to learn that they were walking in the truth. He warns
> the church not to support the false teachers in any way. Despite its
> brevity, this letter expresses all of the themes that receive deeper
> development in 1 John.
