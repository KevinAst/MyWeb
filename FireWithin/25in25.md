### Overview

This app is a companion to the **[25 in
25](https://fbmaryville.org/25-in-25)** campaign ({{book.FBM}}),
designed to help you memorize 25 scripture passages in 2025.

A key feature of the app is the **audio playback**, _that allows you to listen to
scripture on repeat_ — _**helping it take root in your heart and mind**_.

Our prayer is that this tool will be a helpful resource in your journey
through the Bible!

P{ collapsibleSection({
  id:     'memVerseOverview',
  label:  'Tell Me More',
  initialExpansion: 'close',
}) }P

Explore the features of this app _(with some quick tips on how to use them)_:.

- _**Audio Playback**_: You can listen to each passage _**on repeat**_ until
  you stop it. This is especially handy on your phone — _**just pop in
  your earbuds and let the Scripture take root in your memory!**_

  This is the **<mark>key feature</mark>** of this app and _**the
  reason it was created**_!

  You will find the **Audio Playback Control** after each scripture
  _(below)_.  The following elements are included for each audio:

  - **Context** (e.g., _Paul's parting instruction to the church at Philippi_)  
  - **Scripture Reference** (e.g., _Philippians 4:8_)  
  - **Translation** (e.g., _New Living Translation_)  
  - **Scripture Passage** (recited in the selected translation)  
  - **Scripture Reference** (repeated)


- _**Customizable Translations**_: For each memory verse, you may
  select the Bible translation you wish to memorize, from a selection
  of the most popular versions.  The translation used in the **25 in
  25** campaign will be the initial default, and it will always be
  shown in red.

- _**YouVersion Links**_: Each memory verse is a link to the
  [YouVersion](https://www.bible.com/) Bible App, so you can explore
  the passage in greater depth.

- _**Progress Tracking**_: You can keep track of your progress
  _(i.e. the verses you have memorized)_ with the "completed" check
  boxes ✔.

- _**Minimalist View**_: You can collapse both this overview and
  devotional sections found in the app - **to give more prominence to
  the scripture itself**.  

  Simply click the title of any collapsible section _(indicated by an
  arrow - ▶)_, to toggle between expanded and collapsed views.

- _**Multi-Verse Playback**_: In addition to listening to each
  individual memory verse _(one at a time)_, you can choose to listen
  to multiple verses of your choosing.  This audio control is at the
  top of the page _(just under the **Table of Contents**)_.

  You simply select the verses you want to review _(through the
  &#x1F508; audio checkboxes to the right of each verse in the TOC)_,
  and click play on the audio control.  

  When you check the "view verse being played" option, the verse will
  scroll into view during it's play.

- _**Total Recall**_: All these settings are automatically saved, so when
  you return to the site, it will be just as you left it.

  **Please Note**: These settings are stored locally on your
  device. This works well when you are using a single device.  If
  however you are using multiple devices _(say your laptop and your
  phone)_, each device will have their own settings _which you must
  sync manually_.

If we want to have a new life (eternal life), we must deny ourselves
and give up our lives (our own way of living) here on earth.
 
Denying ourselves is the hardest part. In fact, the world teaches
something completely different. The world says, "follow your heart" or
"live your truth." Meanwhile, someone laying down their desires to be
obedient to Jesus is considered extreme and down right crazy.
 
Did you know that the basis for salvation is a denial of self?
 
To repent of sin (turn from sin) and ask for forgiveness (help) from
God is a denial of self. At our core we want to sin. Only with the
Holy Spirit's help can we take this first step of self denial (turning
from sin). And the same is true about each and every step of self
denial.
 
_**The Holy Spirit is our helper**_ in denying ourselves, taking up our
cross daily, and following Jesus. Simply put, obedience is laying down
what we want in order to trust that God knows better than we do.

What we think about is important. We Often allow our minds
to wander and end up in some pretty dark places. It's when
we allow our thoughts to reach their conclusion that we get
in trouble. 

Instead, we should "_take every thought captive to obey Christ_"
[2 Corinthians 10:5 ESV](https://bible.com/bible/59/2co.10.5.ESV).

In M{ bibleLink(`php.4.8@@Philippians 4:8`) }M, the Apostle Paul
teaches us how to begin taking every thought captive.

Next time you have a thought you can ask:

- Is this line of thinking true, honorable, or right?
  
- Are these thoughts pure, lovely, or admirable?
  
- Is this an excellent or praiseworthy way of thinking?

If the answer to any of these questions is "NO", then you know
what to do. 

- Take those thoughts captive and bring them into obedience to Christ.

- _**Allow the Holy Spirit to lead you in truth**_ instead of your
  thoughts leading you into dark places.

Knowing that our thoughts direct our behaviors, renewing our mind
becomes our greatest transformational aspiration.

With a renewed mind, we are able to discern what is God's will and
what is a scheme of the evil one.  _**In other words, we can better
understand God's ways versus the ways of the world.**_

Once we are able to discern these things, it becomes possible for us
to _offer our bodies to God as a living sacrifice_.  _**We can walk in
obedience to Him.**_ _We are pleasing to Him!_

God is patient and kind. 

However, many times we mistake His patience and kindness as a lack of
response. We begin fooling ourselves into thinking sin isn't sin or
that God isn't real because there was no immediate consequence for our
sin.

This verse tells us that _**it's His kindness that leads to
repentance**_. Without His kindness, we wouldn't even have a chance to
repent. 

_**Thank God for His kindness today!**_

When you pray for someone, you can _**follow Paul's example**_.  As an
example, _if you are praying for your pastor_:

- Thank God for your pastor. 
- Thank God for the love your pastor has for the church and for his
  love for the Lord!
- Pray that your pastor's work in the church might deepen his own
  understanding of every good thing we share in the faith.
- Thank God for the times your heart has been refreshed by
  his words or actions. 
- Thank God for bringing joy and encouragement to His people through

God is love. God loves us. His love for us is shown in His patience
and kindness towards us so that we might come to repent of our sin and
follow His perfect ways (and not our own ways).

- If we have been born again, God's love will be on display in our
  life. 
  
- If God's love is not on display in our life, then we are not born
  again.  

God's love is displayed through our obedience to God and the love and
kindness we show others.

Does God really forgive all our sins? Even the really bad ones? The
secret ones?

**Yes, He does!**

When we humble ourselves and confess our sins to Him, we are forgiven
and purified.

Think of it like this: If our sins were dirty spots on our shirt, when
we confess our sins, all the dirty spots on our shirt are wiped away
and we are made clean in God's eyes.

He forgives us when we ask for forgiveness and He wipes our record
clean.

Through faith in Jesus, we can have a right relationship with God. By
believing in Jesus, we are given the righteousness of God. 

**This is amazing news!**

Apart from Jesus, we are all sinners who have fallen short of the
glorious standard of God. 

On our own merit, we fall short. We need Jesus in order to have a
right relationship with God.
