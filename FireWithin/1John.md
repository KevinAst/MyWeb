# 1 John

In his letters, John encourages a congregation under attack by a group
of false teachers he calls antichrists. These antichrists are
preaching a message contrary to the Gospel and doing all they can to
sow discord and confusion. Through John's letters, we learn about the
Good News that Jesus has come in the flesh and why a simple Gospel is
the best antidote to the complexity, confusion, and discord sown
around us.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} 1 John Introduction**

> The letter known as 1 John was sent to a group of believers who were
> in the midst of an unsettling situation. Some of them had abandoned
> faith in Jesus the Messiah as it had first been taught to them. They
> found the proclamation that God had come in a human body impossible to
> reconcile with the common Greek idea that the flesh is evil and only
> spirit is good. But despite their denial of the Messiah, their immoral
> lives and their lack of practical love, they claimed to know God and
> belong to God. They asserted that their spiritual insight put them
> above the rest of the group, which they demonstrated by deserting the
> fellowship. Those left behind were deeply shaken, uncertain about
> everything they had been taught.
> 
> Someone who was close to this community and who had been an eyewitness
> of Jesus wrote to reassure them of what they had heard from the
> beginning. The author doesn’t identify himself, but very likely he was
> the apostle John. Much of the language is similar to the Gospel of
> John. The letter testifies to the reality of the Messiah’s coming in
> the flesh, reassuring the believers that they have full access to the
> truth. It emphasizes godly living and practical caring as the signs of
> those who genuinely know God.
