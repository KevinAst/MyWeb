* Character Descriptions
*------------------------

- Use ChatGPT (AI) to  supplement each character's description highlighted the biblical appearance of each character. 
  ... see ChatGPT "The Chosen Character Guide Supplements" session

  Setup Process:
  . I have created a webpage "Character Guide" for the main characters of
    "The Chosen" - a historical drama based on the life of Jesus Christ,
    as seen through the eyes of those who knew him.
  . I have a short description for each character (one or two sentences).
    I would like to keep that description "in tact", as it is taken from a
    source that I link to.
  . However I would like to supplement this description with some
    additional content (also short - one or two sentences).  
  . This is where I need your help.
  . I will supply the original content for each character, and ask you to
    supply this supplemental text.  The types of things I'm looking for
    are:
    - Where does this character appear in the Bible (if at all).  The main
      characters will in fact appear in the Bible, but some characters may
      be fictitious - added by The Chosen to create a full story of a TV
      series.
    - Some characters may appear in the Bible, but not be named in the
      Bible.  I this case, I would like a statement to that fact.
  . Does this make sense?
  . If so, I will proceed to give you the characters - one by one.
  . I will start with more minor characters, and eventually get to folks
    like the apostles.  Ready?
  . The remaining characters are the apostles of Jesus
