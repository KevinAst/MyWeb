# Micah

**Micah announces God's judgment against Israel.**

Israel has exploited the poor and twisted the laws of the Torah, and
God’s justice means that he will deal with them severely. But Micah’s
prophecies are not without hope. The God of Israel is also faithful
and full of mercy. God promises to preserve a faithful remnant, from
which he will create a new Jerusalem on the other side of sin and
exile.

**The Good Shepherd**

The book of Micah paints a picture of a just yet merciful God. Like a
shepherd, God will one day gather and restore a faithful remnant to
the land. He will rebuild Jerusalem, defeat evil forever, and send a
messianic King to rule over the people and bless all the nations.

## Overview


**{{book.NivBible}} Micah Introduction**

> The prophet Micah speaks to the southern kingdom of Judah during the
> reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah (late 8th century BC). He foresees
> that Samaria and Jerusalem, the capital cities of Israel and Judah,
> will be destroyed because of their injustice and corrupt religion. The
> people have abandoned the covenant God made with them, taking up the
> pagan religious practices of the Canaanites. The rich and powerful are
> ruthlessly exploiting the poor, ignoring the law of Moses. Micah warns
> that in punishment for their unfaithfulness and injustice, both
> kingdoms will be invaded, conquered and exiled. As he predicts,
> Samaria falls to the Assyrians in 722 BC and Jerusalem falls to the
> Babylonians in 587/6 BC.
> 
> Micah’s prophecies alternate between warnings of destruction and
> promises of restoration. Each of Micah’s three groups of oracles
> begins with a series of judgments, and then concludes with promises of
> restoration. Micah proclaims that in compassion and covenant
> faithfulness God will save a remnant of the people and bring them back
> to their own land. There they will be ruled by a righteous king and
> become a light to the whole world, pointing all nations to the ways of
> the Lord. God will help Israel find its place in the biblical drama.
