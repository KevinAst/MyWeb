# Micah

In the book of Micah, the prophet indicts Israel’s kings and prophets
for using their power to prey on their citizens and failing to lead
their nation towards justice. Micah then laments for his people
because he knows Israel must pay for her sin, and that Jerusalem will
soon fall. Jesus embodies the judgment of Micah, even to the point of
death. Ultimately, Micah reveals to us that in Jesus’ death, there is
the hope of a new Kingdom.

## Overview


**{{book.NivBible}} Micah Introduction**

> The prophet Micah speaks to the southern kingdom of Judah during the
> reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah (late 8th century BC). He foresees
> that Samaria and Jerusalem, the capital cities of Israel and Judah,
> will be destroyed because of their injustice and corrupt religion. The
> people have abandoned the covenant God made with them, taking up the
> pagan religious practices of the Canaanites. The rich and powerful are
> ruthlessly exploiting the poor, ignoring the law of Moses. Micah warns
> that in punishment for their unfaithfulness and injustice, both
> kingdoms will be invaded, conquered and exiled. As he predicts,
> Samaria falls to the Assyrians in 722 BC and Jerusalem falls to the
> Babylonians in 587/6 BC.
> 
> Micah’s prophecies alternate between warnings of destruction and
> promises of restoration. Each of Micah’s three groups of oracles
> begins with a series of judgments, and then concludes with promises of
> restoration. Micah proclaims that in compassion and covenant
> faithfulness God will save a remnant of the people and bring them back
> to their own land. There they will be ruled by a righteous king and
> become a light to the whole world, pointing all nations to the ways of
> the Lord. God will help Israel find its place in the biblical drama.
