    - Wikipedia:  Five hundred years after Moses splits the Red Sea, the Seer Samuel
                  (Stephen Lang) anoints Saul (Ali Suliman) from the Tribe of Benjamin
                  as the first king of the Kingdom of Israel for 25 years, yet King Saul
                  gradually becomes prideful of his victories. At the Valley of Elah,
                  1000 BC, the shepherd David (Michael Iskander) prepares to fight the
                  Philistine giant Goliath (Martyn Ford). One year earlier, David
                  rescues his sheep from a lion in Bethlehem. In Havilah, King Saul and
                  the Israelites defeat King Agag (Jeremy Xido) and the Amalekites while
                  the Philistines attack Baal-Hazor. In Gilgal, King Saul sets up a
                  monument to sacrifice and celebrate with spoils of war but spares King
                  Agag, defying the Lord God's command to destroy Amalek. Samuel
                  receives a prophecy in Ramah and confronts King Saul with a rebuke for
                  disobeying the Lord God, who leaves and rejects Saul as the king by
                  choosing someone better to replace him. King Saul loses his sanity
                  after tearing Samuel's robe while Samuel slays King Agag. As David
                  kills the lion in a cave, Samuel searches for the next king.

    - Prime:      One thousand years before Christ, Saul, the first King of Israel,
                  loses God’s grace and consequently also his own sanity. Meanwhile far
                  away from the palace, the legendary seer Samuel becomes aware of a
                  talented young shepherd named David. One of the greatest stories ever
                  told is set in motion.
