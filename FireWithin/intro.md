You may have guessed that I am a believer and follower of Jesus Christ
_(i.e. a Christian)_.  The short version of my faith is I accepted
Christ at an early age, and was active in my Church for many years.
However I felt something lacking in my faith.  I actually fell away
from God much later in life, and through a series of _(what I believe
were miraculous events)_, God called me back into His fold.  Through
the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, I now have a passion to be in His
word daily, allowing it to guide my life and decisions.

## Tech

Technology has radically changed the number of resources that are
available to us all ...  even as believers!  You can install the [You
Version](https://www.bible.com/) Bible App _(on your phone)_ that
contains the entire Bible - any version ... **held right in the palm
of your hand**!  From this you can read the scriptures, or stream an
audible reading of God's word during your commute or work-out.

## How I Study

In my study, I have found that it helps to supplement the reading of
Gods word with a sermon series from a trusted evangelical pastor.  It
simply adds more background and insight that makes the scriptures come
alive.  This of course this     is <mark>in addition to prayer</mark> -
_*asking the Holy Spirit for discernment and guidance*_.

When I study a book of the Bible, I follow this pattern:

1. I like a high-level orientation to the book.  What is the
   background?  Who are the main characters.  Why was the book
   written and what is it's major theme and emphasis?

2. In some cases, I may audibly stream the entire book at a time.
   I am a slow reader, so streaming is a good option for me.

3. Then for the actual study, I will read _(or audibly stream)_ a
   few chapters at a time.

4. I then supplement what I have read with the sermon series that I
   mentioned above.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 through the completion of the book :-)

## Resources

The resources I promote in this blog are readily available through the
internet.  <mark>The problem is</mark> they are somewhat disjointed
and difficult to organize and keep track of _(in the context of a
Bible study)_.

As a result I created this blog.  It is merely an accumulation of
resource links that guide me through the books of the bible.  Because
they are concisely organized, it helps in keeping track of where I am
in my study.

> A word about the resource links found in this blog ... they will
> consistently take you to another tab in your browser.  This is done
> purposefully, so you won't loose your place in your study.  To get
> back to this page, simply re-select it in your browser tabs.

I have settled on the following resources:

1. The {{book.OverviewBible}} gives you a quick orientation of each
   book of the Bible.

2. The {{book.BibleProject}} does the same.

3. The {{book.SpokenGospel}} provides contemporary videos emphasizing
   the major themes of each book of the Bible.
   
4. {{book.CornerstoneChapel}} _(with Pastor Gary Hamrick)_ is a non
   denominational evangelical church in Leesburg, VA.  This is the
   main resource containing the sermon series of each book of the
   Bible.  I have grown to love the ministry of Pastor Gary.  He
   provides so much insight to the scriptures, making them seem to
   come alive _(somewhat akin to watching [The
   Chosen](https://watch.angelstudios.com/thechosen) series on the
   life of Christ )_.

I am so grateful for these biblical resources, and the men and women
of God that have made them possible.

## Work In Progress

You may have noticed that this blog is a work-in-progress.  At the
time of this writing I have compiled only a small number of books in
the Bible.  These represent the books that I have, or am currently
studying _(since my renewed faith)_.  You are welcome to try one of
these existing studies ... **just click on the desired book (in the
Left Nav Bar)**.  I will be adding more as I continue my study.

> If there is a specific book you are wanting to study _(ahead of my
> schedule)_, I would be happy to compile those resources _(it takes
> me roughly 2 hours per book)_.  Please reach out to me and I will be
> glad to add an "early release" of that book :-) You can reach me at
> `kevin AT wiiBridges DOT com`
> or Direct Message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kevinast)

I pray that you find these resources useful in your personal Bible
Study.  May God bless you in your walk with Christ!
