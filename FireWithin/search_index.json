Within\n \nWelcome to my \"Fire Within\" Bible Study Guide!\nYou may have guessed that I am a believer and follower of Jesus Christ\n(i.e. a Christian).  The short version of my faith is I accepted\nChrist at an early age, and was active in my Church for many years.\nHowever I felt something lacking in my faith.  I actually fell away\nfrom God much later in life, and through a series of (what I believe\nwere miraculous events), God called me back into His fold.  Through\nthe empowerment of the Holy Spirit, I now have a passion to be in His\nword daily, allowing it to guide my life and decisions.\nI share more about my Christian faith in the My Faith section.\nTechnology\nTechnology has radically changed the vast amount of resources that are\ninstantly available to us all ... even as believers!\nYou can install the You Version Bible App\n(on your phone) which contains the entire Bible (any version)\n... held right in the palm of your hand!  From this you can read\nthe scriptures, or stream an audible reading of God's word during your\ncommute or work-out.\nIn addition you can find an abundance of Bible study resources on the\ninternet.  The problem is they are somewhat disjointed\nand difficult to organize and keep track of (in the context of a\nBible study).\nAs a result I created this site.  It is merely an accumulation of\nresource links that guide me through the books of the Bible.  Because\nthey are concisely organized, it helps in keeping track of where you\nare in your study.\nHow I Study\nEveryone is going to have their own preference on how they study the\nBible.  In my case, I have found that it helps me to supplement the\nreading of Gods word with a sermon series from a trusted evangelical\npastor.  It simply adds more background and insight that makes the\nscriptures come alive.  This of course this is in addition to\nprayer - asking the Holy Spirit for discernment and\nguidance.\nWhen I study a book of the Bible, I follow this pattern:\n\nI like a high-level orientation to the book.  What is the\nbackground?  Who are the main characters.

This is a non denominational evangelical church in\nLeesburg, VA. I have grown to love the ministry of Pastor Gary.  He\nprovides so much insight to the scriptures, making them simply come\nalive (somewhat akin to watching The\nChosen series on the\nlife of Christ ).\n\n\nI am so grateful for these biblical resources, and the men and women\nof God that have made them possible.\n\nPlease note that this Bible Study Guide is not yet complete.

Whether we accept the truth or not, it is still the truth,\n                and it will be the truth at the end of our lives when we stand before\n                a holy God. The only way to escape the wrath of God and live in peace\n                and joy with him forever is to believe that the blood of Christ is the\n                only thing that can take away our sins.\n -->\nWhy does this matter?\nBefore we get started, I have a question.  It is a rather sobering\none, but something that is very important to consider:\n\nIf you should die this very moment, do you know what your fate would be?\n\nThe bible tells us that the rightful punishment for sin (our natural\nstate) is death and eternal separation from God.  This represents an\nan eternity in hell Romans 6:23,\nJohn 5:29,\nRevelation 21:6-8.\nThe reason this question is so important is that it determines how we\nwill live out eternity.  Whether we accept the truth or not, it is\nstill the truth, and it will be the truth at the end of our lives when\nwe stand before a Holy God.\nWhat does it mean to be a Christian?\nI suspect that many people have a misconception of what it means to be\na Christian.  They look at it as a process of \"pulling yourself up by\nyour bootstraps\" ... to live a good enough life to be accepted into\nHeaven by God.  \nI can appreciate this concept because this is what all other religions\nstrive for.\nThe truth of the matter is nothing could be further from the truth.\nIt is not possible for us to work our way into heaven with our \"good\ndeeds\".  \nWhile we should certainly strive to do good, it should be done from a\ndifferent motivation.  Good works flow from salvation, not the other\nway around.  More importantly it doesn't change our status with God.\nWe simply cannot overcome His holiness gap (it is too great a\nchasm).\nThe Bible reveals that no amount of works (goodness, morality, or\nreligious activity) can gain us acceptance with God.  The moral and\nreligious are in the same boat as the immoral and non-religious.  We\nall fall short of God's perfect righteousness.\n\nThe Apostle Paul declares that all people are under sin,\nand that \"there is no one righteous, not even one\"\n(Romans 3:9-10 referencing\nPsalms 14:3,\nPsalms 53:1-3, and\nEcclesiastes 7:20).\n\nThe Profit Isaiah proclaims that our righteousness is like \"filthy rags\"\nbefore God (Isaiah 64:6).\n\n\nSo what does this mean?  Is our quest to have a relationship with God in vain?\nMore on this in just a bit ...\nGod is Holy\nIn reality, there is a deep chasm between us and the Holy God.  It is\ndifficult to even comprehend how Holy our God is.  What separates us\nfrom God is our sinful nature, and there is nothing we can do in and\nof ourselves to bridge that gap.\nIn the Beginning\nIt wasn't always this way.  When God created the world, we had a pure\nrelationship with Him (in Adam and Eve).  They regularly communed\nwith God in the garden and exerienced sheer happiness and joy.\nBut God gave us free will, and Adam and Eve chose to disobey God\n(and so by inference - us).  Hence ushered in the severing of our\nrelationship with God.\nFrom that very moment in time, God formulated a plan to bring us back\ninto His fold.\nAm I good enough?\nYou might be saying, well I'm a pretty good person ... I look out for\nothers ... I'm not a cheat or a thief ... etc.  Those are all good\nthings, but it doesn't come close to the standard of a Holy God.\n\nJesus reveals that even our thoughts can be sinful\n(Matthew 5:28)\n\nJames tells us that it is our desires that give birth to sinful action\n(James 1:14-15)\n\n\nThe Gospel\nThe Gospel is the Good News that salvation is God's free gift to us.\nBut we must accept it\n(John 14:6\nRomans 10:9-10).\nGod requires a sacrifice for the atonement of our sins.  This is what\nthe Old Testament sacrificial system was (a temporary one, which had\nto be repeated).  In reality, this was simply a picture (or a\nforetelling) of the ultimate sacrifice (a permanent one) ... that is\nof Jesus Christ.  Jesus (who is part of the triune God head - Father,\nSon, and Holy Ghost), who always existed, humbled himself and came to\nearth through a miraculous virgin birth.  He is both God and man.  He\nlived a sinless perfect life.  His ministry modeled the true\nrelationship we can have with God.  He was sacrificed on a cross (the\nmost brutal and shameful death imaginable), as a permanent atonement\nfor our sins.  He rose from the dead (the first of many saints), and\nascended into heaven, where he prepares a place for his followers.\nThe bible tells us that:\n\nAll have sinned\n(Romans 3:10\nRomans 3:23)\n\nThe results of sin is death ... but we don't have to experience\ndeath and hell, for God's gift to us is forgiveness and eternal life\nin heaven with Him\n(Romans 6:23\nJohn 3:16-18)\n\nIn order to receive this gift, you must believe that it is real and\nthat it can truly change your life. This is more than a simple\n\"head knowledge\".  It is an act of trusting Jesus with your heart,\nand turning your life over to Him\n(Ephesians 2:8).\nYou must confess Jesus as Lord\n(Romans 10:13).\n\n\nSalvation is a free gift of God, offered to all who simply ask.\nIf you want to become a Christian, you must fervently\nbelieve in the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus, repent from your\nsin, and ask him to come into and change your life.  You can\nsimply pray this prayer:\n\nLord Jesus, I confess that I have sinned.\nI repent of my sin and turn to you.\nI believe that you died on the cross for me.\nThat you rose from the dead.\nThat you reign in heaven.\nI confess you as my Lord, and my Savior.\nI pledge my life to you from this day forward.\nFill me with your spirit, that I might be your servant.\nThank you for saving me.\nIn Jesus name.\nAmen\n\nThe truth of the matter is Christianity is less about religion, and\nmore about a personal relationship with God.\nIf you prayed this prayer, there are angels rejoicing in heaven\n(Luke 15:10)!  This reveals\njust how valuable you are to God and how much He desires for you to be\nwith Him in heaven forever!  A great victory has been won!  Your next\nstep is to seek out other believers, in a local Bible believing\nchurch, that can assist and disciple you in your new found faith!\nMy Faith\nIn my personal life, I made this profession of faith as a young boy,\nduring a revival of my parents church.\nI was active in my church, trying to live a life that honored God.  I\ncontinued that process into my adult days, raising my family and\ncontinuing to be active in my church.\nHowever, it seemed like I was missing something.  I would see other\nChristians that were \"on fire\" for the Lord.  I didn't have the\npassion to be in God's Word, and my prayer life was non-existent.  It\nseemed like I was merely going through the motions.\nIn 2005 I actually fell away from the church (for almost 15 years).\nI felt even more distant from God, and sin increased in my life.\nA Renewed Faith\nIt was in 2020 when God started working in my heart.  The things in\nthis world seemed to be completely upside down ... pointing to an ever\nincreasing sinful nature of our society (just as predicted in the end\ntimes).\nGod laid on my heart that the difference between my past Christian\nLife and the Christians that were \"On Fire\" for the Lord, was the\nempowering of the Holy Spirit.  This world is complicated and it is\nnot something we can navigate on our own.  We need help.\nI believe there are two distinct aspects of the Holy Spirit in a\nbeliever's life:\n\nThe Indwelling of the Holy Spirit.  This happens at the moment of\nsalvation, and is a one-time occurrence.\n\nEmpowering of the Holy Spirit (or Baptism of the Spirit).  This is\nwhen the Holy Spirit comes upon a person in power.  \nThis is separate and distinct from salvation, and can occur multiple\ntimes in a believer's life.  There are examples in scripture where\none group of believers were empowered by the Holy Spirit multiple\ntimes.  This is something that was missing in my faith, and it is\ncrucial in providing the guidance to navigate life's every day\ntwists and turns (overcoming temptation and sin).\nHow does this happen, you might be wondering?  It's not difficult\nat all.  It happens by simply asking God, and believing by faith.\n\n\n\nFor a full explanation of this concept, please listen to\nPastor Gary Hamrick's Sermon in Acts 2:1-13.\n\nWhen I fervently asked the Holy Spirit to empower me and assist me in\nmy daily life, it was truly a miracle.\n\nThe past sins in my life were greatly diminished.  This was not an\ninsignificant thing ... my desire for long standing addictions were\nsimply removed ... Praise God!\n\nFor the first time I had a passion to be in God's word, soaking up\neverything He has for me through his word.  This has manifest itself\nin this Bible Study blog.\n\nMy prayer life is improving, but still needs work (please pray for\nme in this regard).\n\nI have for the first time, a desire to share my faith with others.\nIf you think about it, this is the most crucial aspect of a\nChristian's life, and part of the Lord Jesus' Great Commission\n(Matthew 28:16-20)\n... sharing the Good News to a lost world.\n\n\nI'm certainly not perfect.  I have and will have a long way to go in\nsolidifying my relationship with God.  But this is certainly a step in\nthe right direction, and I thank God for his provision!\nMay the Lord Bless You\nI pray that if you do not know the Lord, you will consider what has\nbeen presented here, and ask him to come into your life.\nIf you do know the Lord, I pray that God will bless you in your walk\nwith Christ.\nYours In Christ,\n\n\n\n  fw.addInquire('Fire%20Within%20Feedback');\n\n\n\n fw.pageSetup(); "},"OldTestament.html":{"url":"OldTestament.html","title":"Old Testament","keywords":"","body":"\n\nOld Testament\nThe Old Testament includes 39 books which were written long before Jesus was born.\n\n\n\n\nThe Old Testament books are divided into five groups \n(find out more):\n\nTorah (Law of Moses):\n        Genesis\n         Exodus\n      Leviticus\n        Numbers\n    Deuteronomy\n\n\nHistorical Writings:\n         Joshua*\n         Judges*\n           Ruth*\n        1 Samuel*\n        2 Samuel*\n         1 Kings*\n         2 Kings*\n    1 Chronicles*\n    2 Chronicles*\n           Ezra*\n       Nehemiah*\n         Esther*\n\n\nWisdom and Poetry:\n            Job*\n         Psalms*\n       Proverbs*\n   Ecclesiastes*\n  Song of Solomon*\n\n\nMajor Prophets:\n         Isaiah*\n       Jeremiah\n   Lamentations\n        Ezekiel*\n         Daniel\n\n\nMinor Prophets:\n          Hosea\n           Joel*\n           Amos\n        Obadiah*\n          Jonah\n          Micah\n          Nahum*\n       Habakkuk*\n      Zephaniah*\n         Haggai*\n      Zechariah*\n        Malachi*\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that this Bible Study Guide is not yet complete (asteric indicates ToDo).\nTo request a specific book to be added, please see the Work In Progress section.\n\n fw.pageSetup(); "},"Genesis.html":{"url":"Genesis.html","title":"Genesis","keywords":"","body":"\n\nBook Completed\n\nGenesis\nIn the first part of Genesis (1-11), we see that God creates a good\nworld and commissions humans to rule it, but they choose rebellion\nagain and again.

Genesis is traditionally attributed to\nMoses, the one who led the people of Israel out of Egypt.\nGenesis explains how one nation comes to have a special role in God’s\nplan for all of humanity. Early on, the order and harmony of God’s\ngood creation are overwhelmed by the destructive consequences of human\nrebellion and pride. The violence, injustice and suffering that follow\nlead God to condemn and restrain human wickedness through the judgment\nof the great flood. God then makes a covenant with Abraham and his\ndescendants, providing an ongoing framework for the story. The family\nof Abraham—Israel—will be God’s chosen means to bring the nations back\nto himself. Genesis closes with Abraham’s descendants having grown\ninto a league of large tribes, but they are not in the land God has\npromised them. So the story leads naturally into the books that\nfollow.\nThe book is divided into twelve parts by eleven repetitions of the\nphrase this is the account of. Each section is about the life and\nfamily of the person named. These are woven together to document the\nstory of human history and the beginning of God’s plan to restore\nhumanity and their place in his world through Israel.\n\nBible Project\n\nGenesis

Before\nthey do, Moses rallies the people to remind them of God’s law—and why\nthey should obey Him. This is how the book of Deuteronomy gets its\nname: it’s the “second giving” of God’s law.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2013 Deuteronomy Series\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Deuteronomy Introduction\n\nThe book of Deuteronomy records the great speech Moses gives just\nbefore his death. He addresses the generation of Israelites who grew\nup in the wilderness just as they are preparing to enter the land of\nCanaan. God wants this promised land to show what renewed life under\nGod’s blessing looks like. The book presents the covenant in a form\ncommonly used by rulers of the time to make treaties with those they\nruled over. The standard form of these treaties included five\nelements:\n\nThe great ruler is identified by name and title.\nThe history and mighty acts of the great ruler are told.\nThe allegiance and specific duties expected of the ruler’s servants are spelled out.\nBlessings for keeping the treaty and curses for breaking it are listed.\nProvisions for continuing the covenant with future generations are laid out.\n\nDeuteronomy follows this pattern very closely. Moses is identified as\nthe representative of the Great King—the God of Israel—whose mighty\nacts for his people are recalled.

But even\nthough they had broken the terms of their covenant with God, he\npromised to bless them if they repented.\nJeremiah offered this warning and path to restoration for Israel’s\nsouthern kingdom of Judah. But the people didn’t listen. God’s justice\ncan only allow evil to go so far. And when the people still failed to\nturn back to Yahweh, they were exiled to Babylon.\nThe Consequences of Rebellion\nThe prophet Jeremiah announced that God would judge Israel’s sins with\nan exile to Babylon.

The book mixes sermons, prophetic oracles, and biographical\nnarratives of Jeremiah’s experiences during the last years of the\nJudean kingdom. We are given an intimate look into the prophet’s own\nheart as he brings God’s message to his fellow Judeans, who reject him\nand even conspire to kill him.\nThe book begins and ends with historical references to the event\nJeremiah was best known for predicting: the fall of Jerusalem. The\nfour main parts generally consist (in order) of oracles, narratives\n(two sections), and then oracles. Significantly, each of these four\nparts ends with a reference to Jeremiah’s words being written in a\nbook or scroll. A long poetic oracle is inserted in the middle\nnarrative of the book. So Jeremiah’s prophecies appear at the\nbeginning, middle and end of the book, highlighting their\nimportance. The middle oracle, promising a new covenant designed to\nchange the human heart, is shown to be the most important of all. God\nwill do more than simply punish evil—he will overcome it with good.\nThe book of Jeremiah carries us back and forth in place and time as we\nturn its pages, yet its themes are consistent. The message of judgment\nfor wrongdoing is followed by the restorative power of forgiveness and\nnew life: to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build\nand to plant.\n\nBible Project\n\nJeremiah Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  fw.addZoomableImage('Jeremiah_BP', 'Jeremiah_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2019 Jeremiah Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Broken CisternsJeremiah 1-210/21/2018Study Guide 2.A Serious WoundJeremiah 3-610/28/2018Study Guide 3.Wisdom for the CrossroadsJeremiah 6:1611/04/2018Study Guide 4.Something to Boast AboutJeremiah 7-911/11/2018Study Guide 5.A Prayer for Idol HeartsJeremiah 1011/18/2018Study Guide 6.The Right Way to See a Wrong WorldJeremiah 11-1211/25/2018Study Guide 7.A Life that Bears God's NameJeremiah 13-1512/02/2018Study Guide 8.A Change of HeartJeremiah 16-1701/06/2019Study Guide 9.Sanctity of Human LifeJeremiah 18-1901/20/2019Study Guide 10.Good Things Out of a Bad PlaceJeremiah 2401/27/2019Study Guide 11.Stand for What is RightJeremiah 25-2602/03/2019Study Guide 12.RestorationJeremiah 29-3102/10/2019Study Guide 13.A Principled LifeJeremiah 3502/17/2019Study Guide 14.Don't Lose Sight of GodJeremiah 36-3902/24/2019Study Guide 15.The RemnantJeremiah 40-4203/03/2019Study Guide 16.Courage for the DiscouragedJeremiah 4503/10/2019Study Guide 17.Don't \"Wine\" About ItJeremiah 46-4803/17/2019Study Guide 18.Lessons from BabylonJeremiah 49-5203/31/2019Study Guide 1.Broken CisternsJeremiah 1-210/21/2018Study Guide 2.A Serious WoundJeremiah 3-610/28/2018Study Guide 3.Wisdom for the CrossroadsJeremiah 6:1611/04/2018Study Guide 4.Something to Boast AboutJeremiah 7-911/11/2018Study Guide 5.A Prayer for Idol HeartsJeremiah 1011/18/2018Study Guide 6.The Right Way to See a Wrong WorldJeremiah 11-1211/25/2018Study Guide 7.A Life that Bears God's NameJeremiah 13-1512/02/2018Study Guide 8.A Change of HeartJeremiah 16-1701/06/2019Study Guide 9.Sanctity of Human LifeJeremiah 18-1901/20/2019Study Guide 10.Good Things Out of a Bad PlaceJeremiah 2401/27/2019Study Guide 11.Stand for What is RightJeremiah 25-2602/03/2019Study Guide 12.RestorationJeremiah 29-3102/10/2019Study Guide 13.A Principled LifeJeremiah 3502/17/2019Study Guide 14.Don't Lose Sight of GodJeremiah 36-3902/24/2019Study Guide 15.The RemnantJeremiah 40-4203/03/2019Study Guide 16.Courage for the DiscouragedJeremiah 4503/10/2019Study Guide 17.Don't \"Wine\" About ItJeremiah 46-4803/17/2019Study Guide 18.Lessons from BabylonJeremiah 49-5203/31/2019Study Guide\n\n\n2023 Jeremiah Series (My Small Group)\nFirst Baptist Maryville\n\n 1.PreparesJeremiah 1:4-1906/04/2023 2.JudgesJeremiah 2:1-1306/11/2023 3.PersonalJeremiah 7:1-1506/18/2023 4.ExclusiveJeremiah 12:1-1306/25/2023 5.ShapesJeremiah 18:1-1207/02/2023 6.RulesJeremiah 23:1-1207/09/2023 7.PresentJeremiah 29:4-1407/16/2023 8.RedeemsJeremiah 31:23-3407/23/2023 9.WorthyJeremiah 35:5-1907/30/2023 10.SpeaksJeremiah 36:19-3108/06/2023 11.TrustworthyJeremiah 42:7-2208/13/2023 12.JustJeremiah 50:11-20,33-3408/20/2023 13.GoodLamentations 3:19-3308/27/2023 1.PreparesJeremiah 1:4-1906/04/2023 2.JudgesJeremiah 2:1-1306/11/2023 3.PersonalJeremiah 7:1-1506/18/2023 4.ExclusiveJeremiah 12:1-1306/25/2023 5.ShapesJeremiah 18:1-1207/02/2023 6.RulesJeremiah 23:1-1207/09/2023 7.PresentJeremiah 29:4-1407/16/2023 8.RedeemsJeremiah 31:23-3407/23/2023 9.WorthyJeremiah 35:5-1907/30/2023 10.SpeaksJeremiah 36:19-3108/06/2023 11.TrustworthyJeremiah 42:7-2208/13/2023 12.JustJeremiah 50:11-20,33-3408/20/2023 13.GoodLamentations 3:19-3308/27/2023\n\n\n fw.pageSetup(); "},"Lamentations.html":{"url":"Lamentations.html","title":"Lamentations","keywords":"","body":"\n\nBook Completed\n\nLamentations\nJerusalem has fallen\nIsrael’s exile was the direct result of their constant rebellion\nagainst God's covenant despite his persistent warnings through\nprophets.

The book of Lamentations does not tell us who wrote\nthese songs, although tradition ascribes them to Jeremiah. Here we\nwitness people of faith putting into words their struggle to\nunderstand how God could have allowed the city they loved to be so\ndevastated.\nEach of the five songs preserved in the book has 22 stanzas. The first\nfour songs begin with the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet in\nconsecutive order. In the third song the letters are repeated at the\nstart of each of the three lines in the stanza. There are few\nexpressions of hope, but they are placed in the center of the book to\ngive them extra prominence in a situation where they are badly\nneeded.

The opening narrative section presents six stories of\nhow God protected and promoted four young men who were taken into\nexile in Babylon. When Daniel and his friends Shadrach, Meshach and\nAbednego demonstrate their faithfulness to God, they are delivered\nfrom deadly perils by God’s mighty acts. Daniel was given the ability\nto interpret dreams, earning him a valued place in the royal court of\nBabylon, and later in the Persian Empire.\nThe second part of the book describes visions and messages Daniel\nreceived from God through angelic messengers. These visions are\npresented in the cryptic language and symbolic terms typical of\napocalyptic literature. Within them we see the outlines of Near\nEastern history: the empires of Babylon and Persia; the conquests of\nAlexander the Great; and the ongoing strife between the Ptolemys in\nEgypt and the Seleucids in Syria. The visions anticipate an arrogant\nruler, the Seleucid emperor Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who desecrated the\nJerusalem temple in 167 BC. This led to the Maccabean revolt, which\nrestored the nation’s independence and preserved the worship of\nIsrael’s God.\nThe visions in Daniel can also be understood to reveal the conditions\nat the end of the present age, showing it to be a time of definitive\nconflict between God’s people and their enemies.

Following the death of Jeroboam\nII, Israel had six different kings in just over twenty years; four\nwere assassinated and the last was forcibly removed from the\nthrone. The rising empire of Assyria invaded Israel, and by 722 BC had\ncompletely conquered the nation and carried off much of its population\ninto exile.\nIsrael had made the mistake of identifying the Lord with Baal, a\nCanaanite nature god. This identification may have begun innocently\nenough, since baal simply means “master.” But by the time of Hosea, the\npeople were visiting shrine prostitutes, and had adopted the magical\npractices of fertility cults. Hosea repeatedly denounces this\ncorrupted worship as spiritual prostitution. He also condemns the\nnation’s foolish foreign intrigues, its rejection of the moral law,\nand its callous greed. The people dismissed Hosea’s warnings, however,\nand simply mocked him.\nThe book is structured into two main parts. The shorter first part\ntells how God commanded Hosea to marry the unfaithful woman Gomer. She\nis symbolic of Israel’s wavering faithfulness to the Lord. The\nprophet’s own life thus provided a picture of God’s intentions toward\nwayward Israel.

The book contains only a single sentence\nof prophecy.\nThe story concerns God’s call to Jonah to warn the people of Nineveh\nof its coming destruction. The book is structured into two main acts\nwith two scenes each. The repetition of God’s command to Go to the\ngreat city of Nineveh marks the beginning of each act. The first scene\nis set on a ship as Jonah tries to avoid his mission. The second scene\ntakes place in the belly of a huge fish which has swallowed Jonah. In\nthe second act both scenes are associated with Nineveh itself, the\nfirst within the city as Jonah preaches and Nineveh repents, the\nsecond just outside the city as Jonah struggles with God’s mercy.\nJonah’s role in the book is to represent the attitude of many in\nIsrael toward other nations. Instead of accepting their own calling to\nhelp these nations come to know the true God, they considered them\nenemies and expected God to destroy them. The book teaches that God’s\nlove extends beyond Israel to other nations, indeed, to the whole\ncreation. God’s final question to Jonah is intended for all the book’s\nreaders.\n\nBible Project\n\nJonah Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  fw.addZoomableImage('Jonah_BP', 'Jonah_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nJonah Series\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingJONAH 108/29/2012 2.TeachingJONAH 209/05/2012 3.TeachingJONAH 3-409/12/2012 4.The Mercy of GodJONAH01/05/2020Study Guide 1.TeachingJONAH 108/29/2012 2.TeachingJONAH 209/05/2012 3.TeachingJONAH 3-409/12/2012 4.The Mercy of GodJONAH01/05/2020Study Guide\n\n\n fw.pageSetup(); "},"Micah.html":{"url":"Micah.html","title":"Micah","keywords":"","body":"\n\nBook Completed\n\nMicah\nMicah announces God's judgment against Israel.\nIsrael has exploited the poor and twisted the laws of the Torah, and\nGod’s justice means that he will deal with them severely. But Micah’s\nprophecies are not without hope. The God of Israel is also faithful\nand full of mercy. God promises to preserve a faithful remnant, from\nwhich he will create a new Jerusalem on the other side of sin and\nexile.\nThe Good Shepherd\nThe book of Micah paints a picture of a just yet merciful God. Like a\nshepherd, God will one day gather and restore a faithful remnant to\nthe land. He will rebuild Jerusalem, defeat evil forever, and send a\nmessianic King to rule over the people and bless all the nations.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\nMicah Series\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Micah Introduction\n\nThe prophet Micah speaks to the southern kingdom of Judah during the\nreigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah (late 8th century BC). He foresees\nthat Samaria and Jerusalem, the capital cities of Israel and Judah,\nwill be destroyed because of their injustice and corrupt religion. The\npeople have abandoned the covenant God made with them, taking up the\npagan religious practices of the Canaanites. The rich and powerful are\nruthlessly exploiting the poor, ignoring the law of Moses. Micah warns\nthat in punishment for their unfaithfulness and injustice, both\nkingdoms will be invaded, conquered and exiled. As he predicts,\nSamaria falls to the Assyrians in 722 BC and Jerusalem falls to the\nBabylonians in 587/6 BC.\nMicah’s prophecies alternate between warnings of destruction and\npromises of restoration. Each of Micah’s three groups of oracles\nbegins with a series of judgments, and then concludes with promises of\nrestoration. Micah proclaims that in compassion and covenant\nfaithfulness God will save a remnant of the people and bring them back\nto their own land. There they will be ruled by a righteous king and\nbecome a light to the whole world, pointing all nations to the ways of\nthe Lord. God will help Israel find its place in the biblical drama.\n\nBible Project\n\nMicah Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  fw.addZoomableImage('Micah_BP', 'Micah_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nMicah Series\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingMICAH 1-209/19/2012 2.TeachingMICAH 3-409/26/2012 3.TeachingMICAH 5-710/10/2012 4.The Sea of ForgetfulnessMICAH01/12/2020Study Guide 1.TeachingMICAH 1-209/19/2012 2.TeachingMICAH 3-409/26/2012 3.TeachingMICAH 5-710/10/2012 4.The Sea of ForgetfulnessMICAH01/12/2020Study Guide\n\n\n fw.pageSetup(); "},"NewTestament.html":{"url":"NewTestament.html","title":"New Testament","keywords":"","body":"\n\nNew Testament\nThe New Testament includes 27 books about Jesus’ ministry and what it\nmeans to follow him. \n\n\n\n\nThe New Testament books fall into five general categories\n(find out more):\n\nThe Gospels:\n         Matthew*\n            Mark\n            Luke\n            John\n\n\nThe single book of Acts\n            Acts\n\n\nPaul’s letters to churches:\n          Romans\n    1 Corinthians\n    2 Corinthians\n       Galatians\n       Ephesians*\n     Philippians*\n      Colossians*\n  1 Thessalonians\n  2 Thessalonians\n\n\nPaul’s letters to church leaders:\n        1 Timothy*\n        2 Timothy*\n           Titus*\n        Philemon*\n\n\nA collection of letters sent out (mostly) to large groups of people:\n         Hebrews*\n           James*\n          1 Peter*\n          2 Peter*\n           1 John*\n           2 John*\n           3 John*\n            Jude*\n      Revelation\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that this Bible Study Guide is not yet complete (asteric indicates ToDo).\nTo request a specific book to be added, please see the Work In Progress section.\n\n fw.pageSetup(); "},"Mark.html":{"url":"Mark.html","title":"Mark","keywords":"","body":"\n\nBook Completed\n\nMark\nMark is the story of what Jesus did for us.

A Roman\ncenturion’s declaration near the end of the book - Surely this man was\nthe Son of God! - models the witness to Jesus this gospel calls for.\nThe opening half of this fast-moving drama keys on the question: Who\ndo you say I am? An episode at the end of the first half shows Jesus\nhealing a blind man in two stages, so that he slowly comes to see. In\nthe same way the disciples have only gradually come to recognize who\nJesus is. Then in a key moment in the story, between its two halves,\nPeter confesses that Jesus is the Messiah.\nNow the conflict moves out into the open. Jesus has come to introduce\na radical new way of life that will undercut existing power\nrelationships. The second half of the drama depicts this in three\nacts:\n\nJesus and his disciples travel to Jerusalem.\n\nJesus teaches in the temple and clashes with the\nestablished leadership.\n\nIn the final act, that leadership executes its plan and has\nJesus arrested and crucified, seemingly overturning all he has\ndone. But then God overturns their deed and raises Jesus to\nlife. So Mark’s readers are called to be faithful to Jesus, even in\nsuffering, because this is how God continues to overturn the\nexisting order and establish the way of life that Jesus taught.\n\n\n\nBible Project\n\nMark Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  fw.addZoomableImage('Mark_BP', 'Mark_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2013-2014 Mark Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingMark 111/13/2013 2.TeachingMark 211/20/2013 3.TeachingMark 312/04/2013 4.TeachingMark 4-5:2012/11/2013 5.TeachingMark 5:21-6:1312/18/2013 6.TeachingMark 6:13-7:2301/08/2014 7.TeachingMark 7:23-8:3801/15/2014 8.TeachingMark 902/05/2014 9.TeachingMark 9:33-5002/12/2014 10.TeachingMark 1002/19/2014 11.TeachingMark 11-12:1703/05/2014 12.TeachingMark 12:18-13:3703/12/2014 13.TeachingMark 14:1-2603/19/2014 14.TeachingMark 14:12-5203/26/2014 15.TeachingMark 14:53-15:1504/02/2014 16.TeachingMark 15:16-16:2004/09/2014 1.TeachingMark 111/13/2013 2.TeachingMark 211/20/2013 3.TeachingMark 312/04/2013 4.TeachingMark 4-5:2012/11/2013 5.TeachingMark 5:21-6:1312/18/2013 6.TeachingMark 6:13-7:2301/08/2014 7.TeachingMark 7:23-8:3801/15/2014 8.TeachingMark 902/05/2014 9.TeachingMark 9:33-5002/12/2014 10.TeachingMark 1002/19/2014 11.TeachingMark 11-12:1703/05/2014 12.TeachingMark 12:18-13:3703/12/2014 13.TeachingMark 14:1-2603/19/2014 14.TeachingMark 14:12-5203/26/2014 15.TeachingMark 14:53-15:1504/02/2014 16.TeachingMark 15:16-16:2004/09/2014\n\n\n2021 Mark Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Pray Like JesusMark 104/18/2021Study Guide 2.Patches and WineskinsMark 2:18-2204/25/2021Study Guide 3.What Hinders Fruitfulness?Mark 405/02/2021Study Guide 4.Losing Your Head over a GrudgeMark 605/16/2021Study Guide 5.Mountains or Valleys, Jesus is ThereMark 905/23/2021Study Guide 6.Opposition to Jesus and His ChurchMark 1205/30/2021Study Guide 7.What's the Cost?Mark 12:41-4406/13/2021Study Guide 8.When God Tore a CurtainMark 1506/20/2021Study Guide 1.Pray Like JesusMark 104/18/2021Study Guide 2.Patches and WineskinsMark 2:18-2204/25/2021Study Guide 3.What Hinders Fruitfulness?Mark 405/02/2021Study Guide 4.Losing Your Head over a GrudgeMark 605/16/2021Study Guide 5.Mountains or Valleys, Jesus is ThereMark 905/23/2021Study Guide 6.Opposition to Jesus and His ChurchMark 1205/30/2021Study Guide 7.What's the Cost?Mark 12:41-4406/13/2021Study Guide 8.When God Tore a CurtainMark 1506/20/2021Study Guide\n\n\n2023 Mark Series (My Small Group)\nFirst Baptist Maryville\n\n 1.IntroducedMark 1:1-1309/03/2023 2.ProclaimedMark 1:35-4509/10/2023 3.QuestionedMark 3:20-3009/17/2023 4.SatisfiesMark 6:30-4409/24/2023 5.IncludesMark 7:24-3710/01/2023 6.FollowedMark 8:31-9:110/08/2023 7.StrengthensMark 9:17-2910/15/2023 8.ServesMark 10:32-4510/22/2023 9.ClearsMark 11:15-2510/29/2023 10.ReturningMark 13:24-3711/05/2023 11.WillingMark 14:32-4211/12/2023 12.SacrificedMark 15:24-3911/19/2023 13.AliveMark 16:1-1411/26/2023 1.IntroducedMark 1:1-1309/03/2023 2.ProclaimedMark 1:35-4509/10/2023 3.QuestionedMark 3:20-3009/17/2023 4.SatisfiesMark 6:30-4409/24/2023 5.IncludesMark 7:24-3710/01/2023 6.FollowedMark 8:31-9:110/08/2023 7.StrengthensMark 9:17-2910/15/2023 8.ServesMark 10:32-4510/22/2023 9.ClearsMark 11:15-2510/29/2023 10.ReturningMark 13:24-3711/05/2023 11.WillingMark 14:32-4211/12/2023 12.SacrificedMark 15:24-3911/19/2023 13.AliveMark 16:1-1411/26/2023\n\n\n fw.pageSetup(); "},"Luke.html":{"url":"Luke.html","title":"Luke","keywords":"","body":"\n\nBook Completed\n\nLuke\nLuke is the story of Jesus Christ - exactly as it happened ... written\nby the physician Luke.

In the first volume, the movement\nis toward Jerusalem, the center of Jewish national life. In the\nsecond, the movement is from Jerusalem to other nations, closing with\nPaul proclaiming the kingdom of God in Rome, the capital of the\nempire.\nLuke addresses his history to most excellent Theophilus,most likely a\nRoman official. His volumes are stocked with details from sources Luke\nhad available: letters, speeches, songs, travel accounts, trial\ntranscripts and biographical anecdotes. Luke’s purpose is to show the\nfulfillment of God’s plan to bring his light to the world through\nIsrael. The earliest Jesus-followers take up this calling by\nannouncing Jesus’ victory over sin and death to all the nations.\nThe first volume, Luke’s telling of the story of Jesus, has three main\nsections:\n\nJesus ministers in Galilee, the northern area of the land of\nIsrael.\n\nHe takes a long journey to Jerusalem, during which he welcomes\npeople into the way of God’s reign and challenges Israel’s current\nunderstanding of the kingdom.\n\nLuke tells how Jesus gives his life in Jerusalem and then rises\nfrom the dead to be revealed as Israel’s King and the world’s true\nLord.\n\n\n\nBible Project\n\nLuke Introduction\nPart 1: Luke 1-9 ...\nPart 2: Luke 10-24\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  fw.addZoomableImage('Luke_BP', 'Luke_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2014-2015 Luke Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingLuke 104/23/2014 2.TeachingLuke 1:26-8004/30/2014 3.TeachingLuke 205/07/2014 4.TeachingLuke 305/14/2014 5.TeachingLuke 4:1-3005/21/2014 6.TeachingLuke 4:31-5:1105/28/2014 7.TeachingLuke 506/18/2014 8.TeachingLuke 607/02/2014 9.TeachingLuke 708/13/2014 10.TeachingLuke 8:1-2508/20/2014 11.TeachingLuke 8:26-5608/27/2014 12.TeachingLuke 9:1-3609/03/2014 13.TeachingLuke 9:37-6209/10/2014 14.TeachingLuke 10:1-2409/17/2014 15.TeachingLuke 10:25-4210/01/2014 16.TeachingLuke 1110/08/2014 17.TeachingLuke 11:33-5210/15/2014 18.TeachingLuke 12:1-3410/22/2014 19.TeachingLuke 12:35-5910/29/2014 20.TeachingLuke 1311/12/2014 21.TeachingLuke 1411/19/2014 22.TeachingLuke 1512/03/2014 23.TeachingLuke 1612/10/2014 24.TeachingLuke 1712/17/2014 25.TeachingLuke 18:1-3001/07/2015 26.TeachingLuke 1901/14/2015 27.TeachingLuke 20:1-2601/21/2015 28.TeachingLuke 20-2101/28/2015 29.TeachingLuke 22:1-3802/04/2015 30.TeachingLuke 22:38-6202/11/2015 31.TeachingLuke 23-2402/18/2015 1.TeachingLuke 104/23/2014 2.TeachingLuke 1:26-8004/30/2014 3.TeachingLuke 205/07/2014 4.TeachingLuke 305/14/2014 5.TeachingLuke 4:1-3005/21/2014 6.TeachingLuke 4:31-5:1105/28/2014 7.TeachingLuke 506/18/2014 8.TeachingLuke 607/02/2014 9.TeachingLuke 708/13/2014 10.TeachingLuke 8:1-2508/20/2014 11.TeachingLuke 8:26-5608/27/2014 12.TeachingLuke 9:1-3609/03/2014 13.TeachingLuke 9:37-6209/10/2014 14.TeachingLuke 10:1-2409/17/2014 15.TeachingLuke 10:25-4210/01/2014 16.TeachingLuke 1110/08/2014 17.TeachingLuke 11:33-5210/15/2014 18.TeachingLuke 12:1-3410/22/2014 19.TeachingLuke 12:35-5910/29/2014 20.TeachingLuke 1311/12/2014 21.TeachingLuke 1411/19/2014 22.TeachingLuke 1512/03/2014 23.TeachingLuke 1612/10/2014 24.TeachingLuke 1712/17/2014 25.TeachingLuke 18:1-3001/07/2015 26.TeachingLuke 1901/14/2015 27.TeachingLuke 20:1-2601/21/2015 28.TeachingLuke 20-2101/28/2015 29.TeachingLuke 22:1-3802/04/2015 30.TeachingLuke 22:38-6202/11/2015 31.TeachingLuke 23-2402/18/2015\n\n\n2021-2022 Luke Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.God Remembers His OathLuke 108/01/2021Study Guide 2.Lessons from NazarethLuke 408/08/2021Study Guide 3.Healing Soul and BodyLuke 508/15/2021Study Guide 4.Dead Man TalkingLuke 708/22/2021Study Guide 5.Relatable Like JesusLuke 708/29/2021Study Guide 6.Paradox Principles for LifeLuke 909/05/2021Study Guide 7.The Good SamaritanLuke 1009/12/2021Study Guide 8.Lessons From LukeLuke 6:27-4609/19/2021Study Guide 9.An Enemy Named BusyLuke 10:38-4210/10/2021Study Guide 10.Don’t Worry About ItLuke 1210/24/2021Study Guide 11.The Theology of TragedyLuke 1311/07/2021Study Guide 12.Walk Through that DoorLuke 13:22-3011/14/2021Study Guide 13.Once was Lost, Now am FoundLuke 1512/12/2021Study Guide 14.Worldly Wealth for Heavenly GoodLuke 1601/09/2022Study Guide 15.Life After DeathLuke 16:19-3101/16/2022Study Guide 16.Where Are the Nine?Luke 17:11-1901/30/2022Study Guide 17.Practice Persistent PrayerLuke 1802/13/2022Study Guide 18.I Need a MiracleLuke 18:35-4302/20/2022Study Guide 19.Small Man, Big ChangeLuke 19:1-1002/27/2022Study Guide 20.Why Jesus WeepsLuke 19:41-4403/06/2022Study Guide 21.A Glimpse of Life in HeavenLuke 2003/13/2022Study Guide 22.The Rise of Russia and the End TimesLuke 21Ezekiel 3803/20/2022 23.Jesus: Our Passover LambLUKE 22:1-2003/27/2022Study Guide 24.Kissers and WeepersLUKE 22:20-6204/03/2022Study Guide 25.We are BarabbasLUKE 2304/10/2022Study Guide 26.Evidence for the Head, Hope for the Heart (Easter)LUKE 2404/17/2022 27.Discouraged While Walking With Jesus?

Just as the first creation was completed in seven days,\nJohn uses the number seven to structure his book. For the Jews the\nnumber seven represented completeness and wholeness, a finished work\nof God revealing his purpose for the world.\nThe story is told in two main parts. The first describes Jesus’ public\nministry and has seven sections. Each section closes with a report on\nhow people respond to Jesus, either in faith or unbelief. The second\npart is devoted to the Passover weekend, when Jesus gave his life for\nthe world.\nJohn records seven instances in which Jesus revealed his identity by\nusing the phrase I am, the name by which God had revealed himself\nearlier. Similarly, John records seven miraculous signs that Jesus\nperformed. John’s narrative mentions twice that the resurrection of\nJesus took place on the first day of the week. In this way he confirms\nthat the power of a new creation has broken into our world.\n\nBible Project\n\nJohn Introduction\nPart 1: John 1-12 ...\nPart 2: John 13-21\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  fw.addZoomableImage('John_BP', 'John_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2015 John Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingJohn 1:1-3403/11/2015 2.TeachingJohn 1:35-2:1203/18/2015 3.TeachingJohn 2:13-3:2103/25/2015 4.TeachingJohn 3:22-4:2604/08/2015 5.TeachingJohn 4:27-5:1504/15/2015 6.TeachingJohn 5:16-6:2404/22/2015 7.TeachingJohn 6:25-7104/29/2015 8.TeachingJohn 7:1-3705/06/2015 9.TeachingJohn 7:37-8:1105/13/2015 10.TeachingJohn 8:12-5805/20/2015 11.TeachingJohn 9-10:2105/27/2015 12.TeachingJohn 10:21-4206/03/2015 13.TeachingJohn 1106/10/2015 14.TeachingJohn 1206/17/2015 15.TeachingJohn 1307/01/2015 16.TeachingJohn 14:15-2108/26/2015 17.TeachingJohn 14:22-15:809/02/2015 18.TeachingJohn 15:8-16:1509/09/2015 19.TeachingJohn 16:15-17:2609/16/2015 20.TeachingJohn 18-19:1509/30/2015 21.TeachingJohn 19:16-20:1810/07/2015 22.TeachingJohn 20:19-2110/14/2015 1.TeachingJohn 1:1-3403/11/2015 2.TeachingJohn 1:35-2:1203/18/2015 3.TeachingJohn 2:13-3:2103/25/2015 4.TeachingJohn 3:22-4:2604/08/2015 5.TeachingJohn 4:27-5:1504/15/2015 6.TeachingJohn 5:16-6:2404/22/2015 7.TeachingJohn 6:25-7104/29/2015 8.TeachingJohn 7:1-3705/06/2015 9.TeachingJohn 7:37-8:1105/13/2015 10.TeachingJohn 8:12-5805/20/2015 11.TeachingJohn 9-10:2105/27/2015 12.TeachingJohn 10:21-4206/03/2015 13.TeachingJohn 1106/10/2015 14.TeachingJohn 1206/17/2015 15.TeachingJohn 1307/01/2015 16.TeachingJohn 14:15-2108/26/2015 17.TeachingJohn 14:22-15:809/02/2015 18.TeachingJohn 15:8-16:1509/09/2015 19.TeachingJohn 16:15-17:2609/16/2015 20.TeachingJohn 18-19:1509/30/2015 21.TeachingJohn 19:16-20:1810/07/2015 22.TeachingJohn 20:19-2110/14/2015\n\n\n2022 John Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.The Identity and Deity of JesusJohn 105/08/2022Study Guide 2.God Has Saved the Best for LastJohn 205/15/2022Study Guide 3.Spiritual BirthJohn 305/22/2022Study Guide 4.Complete in JesusJohn 405/29/2022Study Guide 5.Miracle at the PoolJohn 506/05/2022Study Guide 6.When Bread Is Not EnoughJohn 606/12/2022Study Guide 7.Living Water -

To\nJesus-followers living directly under the shadow of Caesar, he is\nappealing for help to bring the gospel to the western part of the\nempire. As an apostle, Paul has been set apart to make the royal\nannouncement about the Lordship of Jesus. God’s plan for the world has\nbeen revealed through a descendant of king David—Jesus the\nMessiah. This message demonstrates that God has been faithful to his\ncovenant with Israel.\nThe flow of the letter follows the pattern of the ancient Jewish story\nof slavery and rescue. Humanity is in exile due to the entrance of sin\nand death into the world. Even the Jewish law could not defeat death\nand bring life. But God has come to rescue both Jews and Gentiles\nthrough the death and resurrection of Jesus. A new worldwide family is\nbeing created. Baptism into Jesus breaks the power of evil and brings\nfreedom. The Holy Spirit leads the way into this new life that will be\ncomplete in a new inheritance—a redeemed creation.\nAlthough many in Israel had failed to believe in the Messiah, this\nended up bringing life to the rest of the world. The offer of life\nthrough Jesus remains for all, however, and in the end God’s mercy\nwill triumph over judgment. The closing emphasis is on the practical\nshape of a redeemed humanity’s new way of life.\n\nBible Project\n\nRomans Introduction\nPart 1: Romans 1-4 ...\nPart 2: Romans 5-16\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  fw.addZoomableImage('Romans_BP', 'Romans_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2009 Romans Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Good News and Bad NewsRom 1-208/09/2009 2.What a Gift!Rom 3-508/16/2009 3.The Sin BattleRom 6-808/30/2009 4.Why Israel MattersRom 9-1109/06/2009Study Guide 5.Offering Your BodyRom 12-1309/13/2009Study Guide 6.Unity in the ChurchRom 14-1609/20/2009Study Guide 1.Good News and Bad NewsRom 1-208/09/2009 2.What a Gift!Rom 3-508/16/2009 3.The Sin BattleRom 6-808/30/2009 4.Why Israel MattersRom 9-1109/06/2009Study Guide 5.Offering Your BodyRom 12-1309/13/2009Study Guide 6.Unity in the ChurchRom 14-1609/20/2009Study Guide\n\n\n2016 Romans Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingRom 1:1-2505/18/2016 2.TeachingRom 1:25-3205/25/2016 3.TeachingRom 206/01/2016 4.TeachingRom 306/08/2016 5.TeachingRom 4-5:1106/15/2016 6.TeachingRom 5:12-6:1407/27/2016 7.TeachingRom 6:15-7:2508/03/2016 8.TeachingRom 8:1-2708/10/2016 9.TeachingRom 8:28-9:1608/17/2016 10.TeachingRom 9:16-10:2108/24/2016 11.TeachingRom 11:1-2708/31/2016 12.TeachingRom 11:25-12:209/07/2016 13.TeachingRom 12:3-2109/21/2016 14.TeachingRom 1309/28/2016 15.TeachingRom 1410/05/2016 16.TeachingRom 15-1610/12/2016 1.TeachingRom 1:1-2505/18/2016 2.TeachingRom 1:25-3205/25/2016 3.TeachingRom 206/01/2016 4.TeachingRom 306/08/2016 5.TeachingRom 4-5:1106/15/2016 6.TeachingRom 5:12-6:1407/27/2016 7.TeachingRom 6:15-7:2508/03/2016 8.TeachingRom 8:1-2708/10/2016 9.TeachingRom 8:28-9:1608/17/2016 10.TeachingRom 9:16-10:2108/24/2016 11.TeachingRom 11:1-2708/31/2016 12.TeachingRom 11:25-12:209/07/2016 13.TeachingRom 12:3-2109/21/2016 14.TeachingRom 1309/28/2016 15.TeachingRom 1410/05/2016 16.TeachingRom 15-1610/12/2016\n\n\n2021 Romans Misc\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.The True Nature of God (Barrett Phillips)Rom 1:16-2509/22/2021 2.The Mystery of the Blindness (Amir Tsarfati)Rom 11:2509/26/2021 3.Conformed or Transformed?

So Paul\nwrote to answer the threat to his status as an apostle and to reaffirm\nthe core message that faith in the Messiah is the basis of membership\nin God’s new community.\nPaul doesn’t open his letter by appealing to the apostles in\nJerusalem. Instead, he insists that the gospel I preached is not of\nhuman origin … rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus\nChrist.  Paul is compelled to share this revelation, and he notes that\nthe other apostles support him.\nPaul then proceeds to his main argument, which is that Gentiles who\nhave become followers of Jesus do not need to be circumcised. The new\nworldwide family which had been promised to Abraham is created by\nfaith in Messiah Jesus, not by keeping the Jewish law (Torah). The\nbiblical story had been pointing to this all along.\nBut if following Torah is not the basis of the gospel, won’t there be\nanarchy? Paul answers by describing what Spirit-empowered life looks\nlike in the community of Messiah-followers.

When Timothy returned to Achaia with the\nwelcome news that the Thessalonians had remained faithful, Paul wrote\nto express his joy.\nIn this short letter, Paul first recalls his time in Thessalonica and\ngives thanks for their continuing faith, despite trials and\nchallenges. He teaches them to avoid sexual immorality, to love one\nanother sincerely, and to work hard to earn their own living.\nPaul then addresses a key pastoral question: What is the Christian\nhope for those who have died? He explains that believers who die\nbefore the royal appearance of the Messiah are not lost, but will\nsurely be raised from the dead when he comes. He reminds the\nThessalonians that Jesus will appear suddenly and unexpectedly. They\nshould therefore live in such a way that they would be unashamed to\ngreet him.

The day of the\nLord was a phrase from the Hebrew prophets to describe God’s key\nvictory over every opponent, when his faithful ones would be\nrewarded. The Thessalonians’ concern seems to have been not that the\nday had come and gone and they had missed it, but that it was now\npresent. That would mean nothing more was to be expected from God in\nterms of setting things right. Since they continued to suffer\npersecutions, this was a depressing prospect.\nEven before he contradicts this false report, Paul reassures the\nThessalonians that God will indeed pay back all those who were\ntroubling them. He reminds them of the details he had discussed with\nthem in person of how the day of the Lord would arrive. He then\nrepeats some instruction from his earlier letter, urging them not to\nbe idle but to work hard and earn their own livings.\nAt the end of the letter, most of which would have been written by a\nscribe, Paul adds a greeting in his own handwriting. He wants them to\nknow for sure this teaching is really coming from him!\n\nBible Project\n\n2 Thessalonians Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  fw.addZoomableImage('2Thessalonians_BP', '2Thessalonians_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2010 2 Thessalonians Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\nNOTE: This series covers both First and Second Thessalonians\n\n\n 1.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 1)?1 Thess 1-304/25/2010Study Guide 2.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 2)?1 Thess 4-505/02/2010Study Guide 3.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 3)?2 Thess05/09/2010Study Guide 1.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 1)?1 Thess 1-304/25/2010Study Guide 2.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 2)?1 Thess 4-505/02/2010Study Guide 3.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 3)?2 Thess05/09/2010Study Guide\n\n\n2018 2 Thessalonians Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Teaching2 Thess 105/02/2018 2.Teaching2 Thess 2:1-1205/09/2018 3.Teaching2 Thess 2:13-3:1805/16/2018 1.Teaching2 Thess 105/02/2018 2.Teaching2 Thess 2:1-1205/09/2018 3.Teaching2 Thess 2:13-3:1805/16/2018\n\n\n fw.pageSetup(); "},"Revelation.html":{"url":"Revelation.html","title":"Revelation","keywords":"","body":"\n\nBook Completed\n\nRevelation\nThe book of Revelation is the resolution of all things: the kingdom of\nGod is once again physically and literally restored to earth •\nthe dead are raised • the final judgments are rendered • and\nall things are made new.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2011 Revelation Series\n2020-2021 Revelation Series\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Revelation Introduction\n\nThe ancient Roman Empire defended its economic and political control\nin spiritual terms, calling its gospel the Pax Romana, or Roman\nPeace. While in exile on the island of Patmos, a Jewish Christian\nprophet named John received a vision showing that the cult of emperor\nworship would soon become deadly to followers of the Messiah. The book\nof Revelation (or Apocalypse, meaning unveiling) is a warning,\ncirculated to seven cities in the Roman province of Asia Minor. John’s\nmain point is to challenge and encourage the believers in the midst of\ntheir opposition and persecution.\nRevelation is an apocalypse, a literary form well known in John’s\nday. In an apocalypse a visitor from heaven reveals the secrets of the\nunseen world and the future through vivid symbols. While the symbols\nmay appear strange at first, they become more clear when seen in their\nfirst-century setting and in light of other Bible imagery.\nJohn’s vision has four main parts, each marked by the phrase in the\nSpirit. After words of warning and encouragement to each of the seven\nchurches, John’s visions then center on Jesus—his role in redemption\nand the judgments he brings to the world. The immoral political and\neconomic forces that rebel against God will be destroyed, and the\nMessiah will triumph over all his enemies. The vision closes with the\npromise that God’s faithful servants will reign over the new creation.\nRevelation also functions as the appropriate conclusion to the entire\ndrama of the Bible. John concludes with images from the garden of\nEden, the first story in the Bible. The world will experience a fresh\nbeginning: He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making\neverything new!”\n\nBible Project\n\nRevelation Introduction\nPart 1: Rev 1-11 ...\nPart 2: Rev 12-22\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  fw.addZoomableImage('Revelation_BP', 'Revelation_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\nAs of 3/2022 Spoken Gospel has no Revelation introduction\n\n2011 Revelation Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Unlocking RevelationRev 103/13/2011Study Guide 2.Return to Your First Love -

It's not exactly where things\nbegin, but it certainly is where the things of this world will end!\nThe current state of our world made me realize that something was\nnot right.  Everything seemed upside down.  This caused me to start\nthinking about end times (prompted by my previous Church\nbackground, and the prodding of the Holy Spirit)!\nIf you had told me a few years ago, that I was interested in\nRevelation, I would have laughed :-) It is so symbolic and elusive.\nThis is one topic where assistance is most appreciated (from a\ntrusted source).  Luckily Pastor Gary Hamrick (from\nCornerstone Chapel) made this difficult book come alive\n... try it you'll like it!\n\n\n fw.pageSetup(); "}}}
