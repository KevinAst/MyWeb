The short version of my faith is I\naccepted Christ at an early age, and was active in my Church for many\nyears.  However I felt something lacking in my faith.  I actually fell\naway from God much later in life, and through a series of (what I\nbelieve were miraculous events), God called me back into His fold.\nWith the help of the Holy Spirit, I now have a passion to be in His\nword daily, allowing it to guide my life and decisions.\nI share more about my Christian faith in the My Faith page.\nTechnology\nTechnology has radically changed the vast amount of resources that are\ninstantly available to us all ... even as believers!\nYou can install the You Version Bible App\n(on your phone) which contains the entire Bible (any version)\n... held right in the palm of your hand!  From this you can read\nthe scriptures, or stream an audible reading of God's word during your\ncommute or work-out.\nIn addition you can find an abundance of Bible study resources on the\ninternet.  The problem is they are somewhat disjointed\nand difficult to organize and keep track of (in the context of a\nBible study).\nAs a result I created this site.  It is merely an accumulation of\nresource links that guide me through the books of the Bible.  I have\nattempted to organize them in a concise list, so as to help keep track\nof where I am in my study.\nHow I Study\nEveryone is going to have their own preference on how they study the\nBible.  In my case, I have found that it helps me to supplement the\nreading of Gods word with a sermon series from a trusted evangelical\npastor.  It simply adds more background and insight that makes the\nscriptures come alive.  This of course this is in addition to\nprayer - asking the Holy Spirit for discernment and\nguidance.\nWhen I study a book of the Bible, I follow this pattern:\n\nI like a high-level orientation to the book.  What is the\nbackground?  Who are the main characters.  Why was the book\nwritten and what is it's major theme and emphasis?\n\nIn some cases, I may audibly stream the entire book at a time.\nI am a slow reader, so streaming is a good option for me.\n\nFor the actual study, I will read (or audibly stream) a few\nchapters at a time.\n\nI then supplement what I have read with the sermon series that I\nmentioned above.\n\nRepeat steps 3 and 4 through the completion of the book :-)\n\n\nResources\nRegarding the trusted set of resources found on this site, I am\npromoting the following:\n\nFor the high-level orientation of each book, I offer two resources:\nBible Project, and Spoken Gospel.  You are free to\nuse both of these, or simply choose the one that you prefer.  The\nfirst is a presentation style, where the second is more of a\ncontemporary video series.\n\nRegarding the main resource containing the sermon series on each\nbook, I am using Cornerstone Chapel (with Pastor Gary\nHamrick).  This is a non denominational evangelical church in\nLeesburg, VA. I have grown to love the ministry of Pastor Gary.  He\nprovides so much insight to the scriptures, making them simply come\nalive (somewhat akin to watching The Chosen series on the\nlife of Christ ).\n\n\nI am so grateful for these biblical resources, and the men and women\nof God that have made them possible.\nGod Bless You\nI pray that you find these resources useful in your personal Bible\nStudy.

With that said, this section highlights\na number of things that you should know to get the most out of this\nsite.\nBasic Appearance\nYou can change the basic appearance of the site through the Text\nMenu, found in the upper-left of the page.  You can change the\n• text size • display font • and color theme (I prefer\nthe \"Night\" theme, giving you a dark mode).\n\n  \n\n\nGoing Home\nThe Home menu (found in the upper-right of the page) will take\nyou back to the wiiBridges home page.\n\n  \n\n\nLeft Nav Bar\nThe books of the Bible are accessed through the Left Nav Bar.\nThey are found in the Old and New Testament sections, which are\nthemselves expandable.  By simply clicking the desired book, you will\nwill be taken to the study resources for that book.\n\n  \n\n\nThe Left Nav Bar itself is expandable using the menu control found in\nthe upper-left of the page.  This control is a toggle that will either\nexpand or contract the Left Nav Bar.\n\n  \n\n\nResponsive Design\nThe Left Nav Bar will behave differently, depending on whether you\nuse it on a desktop (or tablet) or a smaller device (such as a cell\nphone).\n\nDesktop (or Tablet)\n\nBecause a desktop (or tablet) has more real estate to work with ...\nThe Left Nav Bar will start out open and remain open as you navigate the site.\n\nPhone\n\nBecause a cell phone has less real estate to work with ...\nThe Left Nav Bar will start out closed and automatically close on each menu selection.\nAs an example, to select a book in the New Testament (assuming you\nare not already in the New Testament), you will need to:\nexpand the Left Nav Bar\nselect \"New Testament\"\n... the New Testament splash page will display, and the Left Nav Bar will close\nexpand the Left Nav Bar once again\n... the New Testament menu has now expanded\nselect the desired book (ex: Acts)\n\n\n\n\nSearch\nYou may search the content of the blog through the search box found at\nthe top of the Left Nav Bar.\nPlease Note that because the blog content is primarily links to\nother resources, this feature is only useful when the term you are\nsearching for is contained in the sermon title, or the introductory\npros.\nResource Links\nAs mentioned in the Welcome Page, this site is merely an\naccumulation of resource links that guide me through the books of the\nBible.  Because they are concisely organized, it helps in keeping\ntrack of where you are your study.\n\n  Desktop Rendition\n  \n\n\n\nA word about the resource links found in this site ... they will\nconsistently take you to another tab in your browser.  This is done\npurposefully, so you won't loose your place in your study.  To get\nback to this page, simply re-select it in your browser tabs.\n\nResponsive Design\nThe layout of the sermon series links will have a slightly different\nappearance, depending on whether you use it on a desktop (or tablet)\nor a smaller device (such as a cell phone).\n\nDesktop (or Tablet)\n\nA desktop (or tablet) has more real estate to work with on your\nscreen.\nThe sermon series will have a more horizontal layout (with up\nto 5 columns).\n\nPhone\n\nWhile a cell phone has less real estate, it is useful if you want to\nstream audio during your commute or workout.\nThe sermon series will have a more vertical layout (with only\n3 columns).\nIf you have the You Version\nBible App installed on your phone, the scripture references will be\nserviced by the Bible App!\nRemember - you can always cast a sermon series from your phone to a TV!\n\n\n\n  Phone Rendition\n  \n\n\n\nWhere Am I?\nIt can sometimes be hard to remember where you left off in your study\n... especially when there are a large number of lessons in a series.\nFor that reason, you will find a \"Completed Checkbox\" for each lesson\nof a Sermon Series.  By simply clicking the checkbox, it will be\nremembered the next time you come back.\n\n  \n\n\nAt a higher level, you can also keep track of which books of\nthe Bible you have completed.

When this happens (and I have\nthe time), I will extract that diagram and make it available as one\nof the resources of this site.\nThese diagrams are typically fairly large, and may not be readable\nwhen restricted by the browser window.  As a result, I have added the\nfollowing features:\n\nYou can \"hover over the diagram\" with your mouse, and it will\nzoom/expand on that section.  On a cell phone you can \"press and\nhold\" your finger to get the same effect.\n\nYou can also \"click the diagram\" to open it in a new tab of your\nbrowser.\n\nfrom there you can re-orient the browser window so it is visible\nconcurrently with the video presentation\nyou can also print the diagram by using your browser controls\n\n\n\n\nTry this out for yourself with the following sample (taken from the\nRevelation series):\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('RevelationTimeline_CS', 'RevelationTimeline_CS.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"MyFaith.html":{"url":"MyFaith.html","title":"My Faith","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Let me take this opportunity to share\na little bit about my faith in Christ ... this is my testimony.\nWhat does it mean to be a Christian?\nI suspect that many people have a misconception of what it means to be\na Christian.  They look at it as a process of \"pulling yourself up by\nyour bootstraps\" ... to live a good enough life to be accepted into\nHeaven by God.  \nI can appreciate this concept because this is what all other religions\nstrive for.\nThe truth of the matter is nothing could be further from the truth.\nIt is not possible for us to work our way into heaven with our \"good\ndeeds\".  \nWhile we should certainly strive to do good, it should be done from a\ndifferent motivation.  Good works flow from salvation, not the other\nway around.  More importantly it doesn't change our status with God.\nWe simply cannot overcome His holiness gap (it is too great a\nchasm).\nThe Bible reveals that no amount of works (goodness, morality, or\nreligious activity) can gain us acceptance with God.  The moral and\nreligious are in the same boat as the immoral and non-religious.  We\nall fall short of God's perfect righteousness.\n\nThe Apostle Paul declares that all people are under sin,\nand that \"there is no one righteous, not even one\"\n(Romans 3:9-10 referencing\nPsalms 14:3,\nPsalms 53:1-3, and\nEcclesiastes 7:20).\n\nThe Profit Isaiah proclaims that our righteousness is like \"filthy rags\"\nbefore God (Isaiah 64:6).\n\n\nSo what does this mean?  Is our quest to have a relationship with God in vain?\nNot at all - please keep reading ...\nWhy does this matter?\n>> KJB: Seperation from God is an eternity in hell?\nCLOSE:        * Why Is the Gospel Message Important for Us?\n                Quite simply, what we do with the gospel determines our\n                eternity. Whether we accept the truth or not, it is still the truth,\n                and it will be the truth at the end of our lives when we stand before\n                a holy God. The only way to escape the wrath of God and live in peace\n                and joy with him forever is to believe that the blood of Christ is the\n                only thing that can take away our sins.\nNIX:     \n\nBefore we get started, I have a question.  It is a rather sobering\none, but something that is very important to consider:\n\n> If you should die this very moment, do you know what your fate would be?\n\n-->\nThe bible tells us that the rightful punishment for sin (our natural\nstate) is death and eternal separation from God.  This represents an\nan eternity in hell Romans 6:23,\nJohn 5:29,\nRevelation 21:6-8.\nThe reason this matter is so important is that it determines how we\nwill live out eternity.  Whether we accept the truth or not, it is\nstill the truth, and it will be the truth at the end of our lives when\nwe stand before a Holy God.\nGod is Holy\nIn reality, there is a deep chasm between us and the Holy God.  It is\ndifficult to even comprehend how Holy our God is.  What separates us\nfrom God is our sinful nature, and there is nothing we can do in and\nof ourselves to bridge that gap.\nIn the Beginning\nIt wasn't always this way.  When God created the world, we had a pure\nrelationship with Him (in Adam and Eve).  They regularly communed\nwith God in the garden and exerienced sheer happiness and joy.\nBut God gave us free will, and Adam and Eve chose to disobey God\n(and so by inference - us).  Hence ushered in the severing of our\nrelationship with God.\nFrom that very moment in time, God formulated a plan to bring us back\ninto His fold.\nAm I good enough?\nYou might be saying, well I'm a relatively good person ... I look out\nfor others, I'm not a cheat or a thief, etc.  Those are all good\nthings, but it doesn't come close to the standard of a Holy God.\n\nJesus reveals that even our thoughts can be sinful\n(Matthew 5:22, Matthew 5:28)\n\nJames tells us that it is our desires that give birth to sinful action\n(James 1:14-15)\n\n\nThe Gospel\nThe Gospel is the Good News that salvation is God's free gift to us.\nBut we must accept it\n(John 14:6\nRomans 10:9-10).\nGod requires a sacrifice for the atonement of our sins.  This is what\nthe Old Testament sacrificial system was (a temporary one, which had\nto be repeated).  In reality, this was simply a picture (or a\nforetelling) of the ultimate sacrifice (a permanent one) ... that is\nof Jesus Christ.  Jesus (who is part of the triune God head - Father,\nSon, and Holy Ghost), who always existed, humbled himself and came to\nearth through a miraculous virgin birth.  He is both God and man.  He\nlived a sinless perfect life.  His ministry modeled the true\nrelationship we can have with God.  He was sacrificed on a cross (the\nmost brutal and shameful death imaginable), as a permanent atonement\nfor our sins.  He rose from the dead (the first of many saints), and\nascended into heaven, where he prepares a place for his followers.\nThe bible tells us that:\n\nAll have sinned\n(Romans 3:10\nRomans 3:23)\n\nThe results of sin is death ... but we don't have to experience\ndeath and hell, for God's gift to us is forgiveness and eternal life\nin heaven with Him\n(Romans 6:23\nJohn 3:16-18)\n\nIn order to receive this gift, you must believe that it is real and\nthat it can truly change your life. This is more than a simple\n\"head knowledge\".  It is an act of trusting Jesus with your heart,\nand turning your life over to Him\n(Ephesians 2:8).\nYou must confess Jesus as Lord\n(Romans 10:13).\n\n\nSalvation is a free gift of God, offered to all who simply ask.\nIf you want to become a Christian, you must fervently\nbelieve in the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus, repent from your\nsin, and ask him to come into and change your life.  You can\nsimply pray this prayer:\n\nLord Jesus, I confess that I have sinned.\nI repent of my sin and turn to you.\nI believe that you died on the cross for me.\nThat you rose from the dead.\nThat you reign in heaven.\nI confess you as my Lord, and my Savior.\nI pledge my life to you from this day forward.\nFill me with your spirit, that I might be your servant.\nThank you for saving me.\nIn Jesus name.\nAmen\n\nThe truth of the matter is Christianity is less about religion, and\nmore about a personal relationship with God.\nIf you prayed this prayer, there are angels rejoicing in heaven\n(Luke 15:10)!  This reveals\njust how valuable you are to God and how much He desires for you to be\nwith Him in heaven forever!  A great victory has been won!  Your next\nstep is to seek out other believers, in a local Bible believing\nchurch, that can assist and disciple you in your new found faith!\nMy Faith\nIn my personal life, I asked Jesus to come into my life as a young boy,\nduring a revival of my parents church.\nI was active in my church, trying to live a life that honored God.  I\ncontinued that process into my adult days, raising my family and\ncontinuing to be active in my church.\nHowever, it seemed like I was missing something.  I would see other\nChristians that were \"on fire\" for the Lord.  I didn't have the\npassion to be in God's Word, and my prayer life was non-existent.  It\nseemed like I was merely going through the motions.\nIn 2005 I actually fell away from the church (for almost 15 years).\nI felt even more distant from God, and sin increased in my life.\nA Renewed Faith\nIt was in 2020 when God started working in my heart.  The things in\nthis world seemed to be completely upside down ... pointing to an ever\nincreasing sinful nature of our society (just as predicted in the end\ntimes).\nGod laid on my heart that the difference between my past Christian\nlife and the Christians I felt were sincere in their faith, was the\nempowering of the Holy Spirit.  This world is complicated and it is\nnot something we can navigate on our own.  We need help.\nI believe there are two distinct aspects of the Holy Spirit in a\nbeliever's life:\n\nThe Indwelling of the Holy Spirit.  This happens at the moment of\nsalvation, and is a one-time occurrence.\n\nEmpowering of the Holy Spirit (or Baptism of the Spirit).  This is\nwhen the Holy Spirit comes upon a person in power.  \nThis is separate and distinct from salvation, and can occur multiple\ntimes in a believer's life.  There are examples in scripture where\none group of believers were empowered by the Holy Spirit multiple\ntimes.  This is something that was missing in my faith, and it is\ncrucial in providing the guidance to navigate life's every day\ntwists and turns (overcoming temptation and sin).\nHow does this happen, you might be wondering?  It's not difficult\nat all.  It happens by simply asking God, and believing by faith.\n\n\n\nFor a full explanation of this concept, please listen to\nPastor Gary Hamrick's Sermon in Acts 2:1-13.\n\nWhen I fervently asked the Holy Spirit to empower me and assist me in\nmy daily life, it was truly a miracle.\n\nThe past sins in my life were greatly diminished.  This was not an\ninsignificant thing.  My desire for long standing addictions were\nsimply removed (Praise God)!\n\nFor the first time I had a passion to be in God's word, soaking up\neverything He has for me through his word.  This has manifest itself\nin this Bible Study guide.\n\nMy prayer life is much improved!

Through the second part of Genesis (12-50), we see\nhow God promises to bless the world through Abraham’s family, despite\ntheir repeated failure.\nGenesis demonstrates how God can take all the evil we create and make\nsomething good. And he does so, not because he has to or even because\nhe should, but because he made a gracious promise that he\nwould. Despite all the sin we see through Genesis, God preserves a\nfamily line that would ultimately lead to Jesus. He is the one who\ntakes all our evil and puts it right in his death, burial, and\nresurrection.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2010 Genesis Series (Mid Week)\n2011 Genesis Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Genesis Introduction\n\nGenesis and the other “books of Moses” (Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and\nDeuteronomy) introduce the continuous story of Israel running through\nthe first quarter of the Bible. Genesis is traditionally attributed to\nMoses, the one who led the people of Israel out of Egypt.\nGenesis explains how one nation comes to have a special role in God’s\nplan for all of humanity. Early on, the order and harmony of God’s\ngood creation are overwhelmed by the destructive consequences of human\nrebellion and pride. The violence, injustice and suffering that follow\nlead God to condemn and restrain human wickedness through the judgment\nof the great flood. God then makes a covenant with Abraham and his\ndescendants, providing an ongoing framework for the story. The family\nof Abraham—Israel—will be God’s chosen means to bring the nations back\nto himself. Genesis closes with Abraham’s descendants having grown\ninto a league of large tribes, but they are not in the land God has\npromised them. So the story leads naturally into the books that\nfollow.\nThe book is divided into twelve parts by eleven repetitions of the\nphrase this is the account of. Each section is about the life and\nfamily of the person named. These are woven together to document the\nstory of human history and the beginning of God’s plan to restore\nhumanity and their place in his world through Israel.\n\nBible Project\n\nGenesis

Exodus is where we\nfind the stories of the Ten Plagues, the first Passover, the parting\nof the Red Sea, and the Ten Commandments.\nExodus helps us answer the question, \"Who is God?\" What we find is\nthat God is the God who shows up and saves. This is most fully\nachieved in the person of Jesus, who showed up in human flesh to offer\na new and better salvation.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\nThe Ten Commandments\nExodus Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Exodus Introduction\n\nThe books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers continue the story of how\nGod formed the nation of Israel to play a special role in his plans\nfor the whole world. When the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, God\ncame to them and worked powerfully through Moses to deliver them. At\nMount Sinai, God revealed his laws to Moses, including the Ten\nCommandments, and confirmed his covenant with the young nation. Israel\nbuilt a “tabernacle,” or “tent of meeting,” so that God could live\namong them. The people then traveled through the wilderness to the\nland of Canaan.\nThe boundaries between the books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers are\nnot sharply drawn. The key structure throughout the books relates to\nthe various places the Israelites stopped on their journey. Each\nlocation is noted, and the events at each one are described. The key\nlocation is Mount Sinai; the second half of Exodus, all of Leviticus,\nand the beginning of Numbers describe what took place there. Leviticus\nspecifically contains the laws and regulations the Lord gave to\nIsrael. Numbers reports how the people were organized into a fighting\nforce and moved toward the promised land.\nNumbers reaches back across Leviticus and Exodus and repeats the\nphrase that structures Genesis: This is the account of the family of\nAaron and Moses (Num. 3:1). Appropriately, we hear this phrase for the\ntwelfth time as the twelve tribes are being organized into a\nnation. Near the end of Numbers the prophet Balaam says to Israel, May\nthose who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed.

This book is filled with details on how the people of God\nshould live, eat, sacrifice, celebrate, and more.\nHow can we live in God’s presence? The answer is given to us in the\nbook of Leviticus. If we are ever to dwell with God we must become\nlike God, we must be holy as he is holy. Atonement provided a\ntemporary way to take our darkness and make it light, but we needed a\nmore permanent solution. That is why Jesus, who is God's light itself,\ntook on our darkness to make us holy like him.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2013 Leviticus Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Leviticus Introduction\n\nThe books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers continue the story of how\nGod formed the nation of Israel to play a special role in his plans\nfor the whole world.

Before\nthey do, Moses rallies the people to remind them of God’s law—and why\nthey should obey Him. This is how the book of Deuteronomy gets its\nname: it’s the “second giving” of God’s law.\nDeuteronomy tells the story of Israel's inability to obey God's\nLaw. This disobedience leads to death, exile, and hopelessness. But\nsince Jesus keeps the whole Law for us, we can be free from death and\nenter into eternal life with him. Beyond this, Jesus writes the Law on\nour hearts by his Spirit. This enables us to finally be Law keepers\ninstead of Law breakers.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2013 Deuteronomy Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Deuteronomy Introduction\n\nThe book of Deuteronomy records the great speech Moses gives just\nbefore his death. He addresses the generation of Israelites who grew\nup in the wilderness just as they are preparing to enter the land of\nCanaan. God wants this promised land to show what renewed life under\nGod’s blessing looks like. The book presents the covenant in a form\ncommonly used by rulers of the time to make treaties with those they\nruled over. The standard form of these treaties included five\nelements:\n\nThe great ruler is identified by name and title.\nThe history and mighty acts of the great ruler are told.\nThe allegiance and specific duties expected of the ruler’s servants are spelled out.\nBlessings for keeping the treaty and curses for breaking it are listed.\nProvisions for continuing the covenant with future generations are laid out.\n\nDeuteronomy follows this pattern very closely. Moses is identified as\nthe representative of the Great King—the God of Israel—whose mighty\nacts for his people are recalled. Moses reminds them to give exclusive\nallegiance to their king and lists their duties. He then calls on the\npeople to join in a sacred oath to ratify the covenant. After naming a\nsuccessor and climbing a mountain to look out over the land, Moses\ndies. The people of Israel stand on the edge of their inheritance, the\npromise of a new creation before them.\n\nBible Project\n\nDeuteronomy Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Deuteronomy_BP', 'Deuteronomy_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2013 Deuteronomy Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Three Reasons to Keep God's WordDeuteronomy 1-409/08/2013Study Guide 2.When Life is Good, Don't Forget GodDeuteronomy 5-909/15/2013Study Guide 3.Be Transformed, Not ConformedDeuteronomy 10-1809/22/2013Study Guide 4.Jesus - Our City of RefugeDeuteronomy 19-2509/29/2013Study Guide 5.Honor God with What you HaveDeuteronomy 2610/06/2013Study Guide 6.Principles of Blessings and CursesDeuteronomy 27-3010/20/2013Study Guide 7.The Songs of MosesDeuteronomy 31-3410/27/2013Study Guide 1.Three Reasons to Keep God's WordDeuteronomy 1-409/08/2013Study Guide 2.When Life is Good, Don't Forget GodDeuteronomy 5-909/15/2013Study Guide 3.Be Transformed, Not ConformedDeuteronomy 10-1809/22/2013Study Guide 4.Jesus - Our City of RefugeDeuteronomy 19-2509/29/2013Study Guide 5.Honor God with What you HaveDeuteronomy 2610/06/2013Study Guide 6.Principles of Blessings and CursesDeuteronomy 27-3010/20/2013Study Guide 7.The Songs of MosesDeuteronomy 31-3410/27/2013Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Joshua.html":{"url":"Joshua.html","title":"Joshua","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Israel's ancestral\nland has been taken over by the Canaanites. But God appoints Joshua to\nlead his people back onto their land and into battle. This meant the\nCanaanites' destruction by Joshua's sword, but ultimately Joshua\npoints us to Jesus' destruction on the cross. Jesus is how we can live\nwith God again.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2014 Joshua Series (Sundays)\n2021 Joshua Series (Mid Week)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Joshua Introduction\n\nThe books of Joshua and Judges tell the story of the early years of\nIsrael as a nation. They describe how the Israelites conquer and\noccupy the land of Canaan, and then struggle to live up to their\ncovenant with God. The Bible’s drama here moves to an important new\nstage—God’s people are in God’s land. Yet it becomes clear that the\nroad to reconciliation between God and humanity will not be easy.\nThe story describes the preparations and battles of Israel’s invasion,\nas well as how the land was divided among the tribes. Since pockets of\nresistance remained, Joshua in his final speech urges each tribe to\ntake full possession of its territory. Next he leads the people to\nrenew their commitment to the covenant relationship with God.\nJudges then relates the troubling cycle of Israel’s repeated covenant\nbreaking, falling under the rule of other nations, and then crying out\nto God for help. God responds by raising up “judges” to fight for them\nand save them. But the relief is temporary as Israel falls back into\nwrongdoing once again. (“Judges” are both military leaders and legal\nauthorities.)\nJust as Israel was made up of twelve tribes, so the book tells of\ntwelve judges.

Israel's\nleaders were supposed to save Israel from their sinful enemies in the\nPromised Land. But as the book goes on Israel's saviors, and Israel\nherself, get worse and worse. Ultimately, these saviors are ironic\njudgments. They are Israel's sin reflected in their leadership until\nfinally, they are no saviors left. But Jesus comes as the final leader\nwho both saves us from our enemies and from God's judgment.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2014 Judges Series (Sundays)\n2022 Judges Series (Mid Week)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Judges Introduction\n\nThe books of Joshua and Judges tell the story of the early years of\nIsrael as a nation. They describe how the Israelites conquer and\noccupy the land of Canaan, and then struggle to live up to their\ncovenant with God. The Bible’s drama here moves to an important new\nstage—God’s people are in God’s land. Yet it becomes clear that the\nroad to reconciliation between God and humanity will not be easy.\nThe story describes the preparations and battles of Israel’s invasion,\nas well as how the land was divided among the tribes. Since pockets of\nresistance remained, Joshua in his final speech urges each tribe to\ntake full possession of its territory. Next he leads the people to\nrenew their commitment to the covenant relationship with God.\nJudges then relates the troubling cycle of Israel’s repeated covenant\nbreaking, falling under the rule of other nations, and then crying out\nto God for help. God responds by raising up “judges” to fight for them\nand save them. But the relief is temporary as Israel falls back into\nwrongdoing once again. (“Judges” are both military leaders and legal\nauthorities.)\nJust as Israel was made up of twelve tribes, so the book tells of\ntwelve judges. But as the people persist in going their own way, we\nsee that they have rejected their true Judge and Ruler. As the anarchy\nand atrocities increase, Israel’s need for a king becomes more\nevident. By the end the questions are urgent: Can Israel fulfill its\ndestiny and calling to be God’s light to the nations? Who can rule\nIsrael to help it find its proper role in the drama?\n\nBible Project\n\nJudges Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Judges_BP', 'Judges_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2014 Judges Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Conquer, or Be ConqueredJudges 102/09/2014Study Guide 2.Jesus ONLYJudges 2-302/16/2014Study Guide 3.Killing SiseraJudges 4-502/23/2014Study Guide 4.Lessons from GideonJudges 6-703/02/2014Study Guide 5.Finish WellJudges 8-903/09/2014Study Guide 6.Words MatterJudges 10-1203/16/2014Study Guide 7.Forbidden Vineyards and Sweet TemptationsJudges 13-1403/23/2014Study Guide 8.The Cost of CompromiseJudges 15-1603/30/2014Study Guide 9.Doing What is Right in GOD's EyesJudges 17-2104/06/2014Study Guide 1.Conquer, or Be ConqueredJudges 102/09/2014Study Guide 2.Jesus ONLYJudges 2-302/16/2014Study Guide 3.Killing SiseraJudges 4-502/23/2014Study Guide 4.Lessons from GideonJudges 6-703/02/2014Study Guide 5.Finish WellJudges 8-903/09/2014Study Guide 6.Words MatterJudges 10-1203/16/2014Study Guide 7.Forbidden Vineyards and Sweet TemptationsJudges 13-1403/23/2014Study Guide 8.The Cost of CompromiseJudges 15-1603/30/2014Study Guide 9.Doing What is Right in GOD's EyesJudges 17-2104/06/2014Study Guide\n\n\n2022 Judges Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingJudges 110/13/2021 2.TeachingJudges 2-3:3010/20/2021 3.TeachingJudges 3:31-4:2411/03/2021 4.TeachingJudges 5-6:1211/10/2021 5.TeachingJudges 6:11-4011/17/2021 6.TeachingJudges 701/05/2022 7.TeachingJudges 801/12/2022 8.TeachingJudges 901/19/2022 9.TeachingJudges 10-1101/26/2022 10.TeachingJudges 11:29-1202/02/2022 11.TeachingJudges 13-14:1102/09/2022 12.TeachingJudges 14-1502/16/2022 13.TeachingJudges 1602/23/2022 14.TeachingJudges 17-1803/02/2022 15.TeachingJudges 19-2003/16/2022 16.TeachingJudges 20-2103/23/2022 1.TeachingJudges 110/13/2021 2.TeachingJudges 2-3:3010/20/2021 3.TeachingJudges 3:31-4:2411/03/2021 4.TeachingJudges 5-6:1211/10/2021 5.TeachingJudges 6:11-4011/17/2021 6.TeachingJudges 701/05/2022 7.TeachingJudges 801/12/2022 8.TeachingJudges 901/19/2022 9.TeachingJudges 10-1101/26/2022 10.TeachingJudges 11:29-1202/02/2022 11.TeachingJudges 13-14:1102/09/2022 12.TeachingJudges 14-1502/16/2022 13.TeachingJudges 1602/23/2022 14.TeachingJudges 17-1803/02/2022 15.TeachingJudges 19-2003/16/2022 16.TeachingJudges 20-2103/23/2022\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Ruth.html":{"url":"Ruth.html","title":"Ruth","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Ruth\nwas written when there was no king in Israel, during the evil and\nchaotic time of the Judges. But in the middle of the chaos, God\nprovides not only food and family for a destitute widow but a king and\na hope for a nation on the brink.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2014 Ruth Series (Sundays)\n2022 Ruth Series (Mid Week)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Ruth Introduction\n\nThe short book of Ruth is a bridge between the two major parts of\nIsrael’s covenant history. The first part (Genesis–Judges) focuses on\nhow Abraham’s descendants became a nation and on the covenant God made\nwith Israel. The second part (Samuel–Kings) tells the story of the\nnation’s kings and the covenant God made with David as the head of\nIsrael’s royal line. Ruth helps the transition by opening in the days\nof the judges and ending with the genealogy of David.\nThe book appears to have been written to defend David’s right to be\nking. He was the great-grandson of a Moabite named Ruth. Because the\npeople of Moab didn’t help the Israelites when they came out of Egypt,\nthe law didn’t permit any descendant of a Moabite to join Israel, down\nto the tenth generation. If they couldn’t even join the community, how\ncould one of them serve as king?\nThe book is set up like a drama or stage play. Each scene features a\nshort introduction and then dialogue between the characters. The book\nends with a ten-generation genealogy leading up to David. So the form\nof the book mirrors its purpose, which is to show that genuine faith\nwas present in a woman from a nation whose descendants were normally\nexcluded for ten generations.\nThe book also shows how God’s purposes are accomplished in the\nworld. God’s good laws (allowing the poor to collect grain in the\nfields), his providence over events, and the personal kindness of\npeople all combine to help the story find a redemptive conclusion.\n\nBible Project\n\nRuth Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Ruth_BP', 'Ruth_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2014 Ruth Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Handling Adversity: Flight, Fright, or Fight?Ruth 1:1-1204/27/2014Study Guide 2.When Bitter Becomes BetterRuth 1:13-2205/04/2014Study Guide 3.Romance and ProvidenceRuth 205/11/2014Study Guide 4.Love and RedemptionRuth 3-405/18/2014Study Guide 1.Handling Adversity: Flight, Fright, or Fight?Ruth 1:1-1204/27/2014Study Guide 2.When Bitter Becomes BetterRuth 1:13-2205/04/2014Study Guide 3.Romance and ProvidenceRuth 205/11/2014Study Guide 4.Love and RedemptionRuth 3-405/18/2014Study Guide\n\n\n2022 Ruth Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingRuth 103/30/2022 2.TeachingRuth 204/06/2022 3.TeachingRuth 305/04/2022 4.TeachingRuth 405/11/2022 1.TeachingRuth 103/30/2022 2.TeachingRuth 204/06/2022 3.TeachingRuth 305/04/2022 4.TeachingRuth 405/11/2022\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"1Samuel.html":{"url":"1Samuel.html","title":"1 Samuel","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

The true King of\nIsrael will humbly listen to God's word, and God's Kingdom will be\nestablished in humility, not pride. But both Saul and David fail to be\nthis humble King and fail to build the nation God desires. It is only\nJesus who humbly listens to the voice of God. It is only Jesus who\nestablishes a nation of humility. And it is only Jesus who can cause\nevery proud king to bow.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2014 1 Samuel Series (Sundays)\n2023 1 Samuel Series (Mid Week)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible 1 Samuel Introduction\n\nThe books commonly known as 1 & 2 Samuel and 1 & 2 Kings are really\none long book. (They were separated due to the length of ancient\nscrolls.) Beginning with Samuel, the last of the judges, this book\ndescribes what happened in the days of the kings who ruled first the\nwhole nation, and then the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The\nreigns of Saul and David are described in detail. The repeating\nstructure within the book tells how old a king was when he came to the\nthrone, where and for how long he ruled, and something about his\ncharacter and the notable events of his reign. (Some traditions call\nthis book the “Book of Reigns.”)\nBeneath this pattern of historical succession, however, another rhythm\ncan be discerned. Saul, the first king, does not follow God\nfaithfully, and God announces he will seek a man after his own heart\nto rule Israel. God finds this person in David. He puts him on the\nthrone, promising that his descendants will always rule Israel if they\ncontinue to serve him. Unfortunately, the kings after David are not\ncommitted to following God’s way. Many of them abandon God and lead\nthe people to do the same, although a few of them call the people back\nto obedience. Using David’s wholehearted dedication to the Lord as its\nstandard, the book of Samuel-Kings traces the tragic wavering of the\npeople’s devotion to God. Their covenant failure leads to the nation\nfirst being divided and then later conquered by the powerful empires\nto the east.\nThe “Book of Reigns” is therefore a tragic closing of the whole\ncovenant history that began in Genesis. Just as the first humans were\nexiled from God’s garden, now Israel is sent out of the “new Eden” God\nintended in the promised land.

(They were separated due to the length of ancient\nscrolls.) Beginning with Samuel, the last of the judges, this book\ndescribes what happened in the days of the kings who ruled first the\nwhole nation, and then the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The\nreigns of Saul and David are described in detail. The repeating\nstructure within the book tells how old a king was when he came to the\nthrone, where and for how long he ruled, and something about his\ncharacter and the notable events of his reign. (Some traditions call\nthis book the “Book of Reigns.”)\nBeneath this pattern of historical succession, however, another rhythm\ncan be discerned. Saul, the first king, does not follow God\nfaithfully, and God announces he will seek a man after his own heart\nto rule Israel. God finds this person in David. He puts him on the\nthrone, promising that his descendants will always rule Israel if they\ncontinue to serve him. Unfortunately, the kings after David are not\ncommitted to following God’s way. Many of them abandon God and lead\nthe people to do the same, although a few of them call the people back\nto obedience. Using David’s wholehearted dedication to the Lord as its\nstandard, the book of Samuel-Kings traces the tragic wavering of the\npeople’s devotion to God. Their covenant failure leads to the nation\nfirst being divided and then later conquered by the powerful empires\nto the east.\nThe “Book of Reigns” is therefore a tragic closing of the whole\ncovenant history that began in Genesis. Just as the first humans were\nexiled from God’s garden, now Israel is sent out of the “new Eden” God\nintended in the promised land. Land and temple have been lost in the\ndarkness of judgment, and only a flickering light remains.

But hope remains alive in God’s\npromise to bring a descendant of David back to the throne.\n\nBible Project\n\n2 Kings Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('12Kings_BP', '12Kings_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2015 2 Kings Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Desperate Times, Desperate Prayers2 Kings 104/12/2015Study Guide 2.If Today Were My Last Day: No Regrets2 Kings 204/19/2015Study Guide 3.Wowed by God2 Kings 3-404/26/2015Study Guide 4.Healing Naaman2 Kings 505/03/2015Study Guide 5.We Can't Keep it to Ourselves2 Kings 6-705/10/2015Study Guide 6.Getting God's Peace2 Kings 8-1005/17/2015Study Guide 7.Standing Firm When Heroes Die2 Kings 11-1205/24/2015Study Guide 8.Principles from a Good King2 Kings 13-1605/31/2015Study Guide 9.Warnings from a Just and Patient God2 Kings 1706/07/2015Study Guide 10.Don't Be So Full of Yourself2 Kings 18-2006/14/2015Study Guide 11.The Effect of God's Word2 Kings 21-2306/21/2015Study Guide 12.God Has Not Forsaken His People2 Kings 24-2506/28/2015Study Guide 1.Desperate Times, Desperate Prayers2 Kings 104/12/2015Study Guide 2.If Today Were My Last Day: No Regrets2 Kings 204/19/2015Study Guide 3.Wowed by God2 Kings 3-404/26/2015Study Guide 4.Healing Naaman2 Kings 505/03/2015Study Guide 5.We Can't Keep it to Ourselves2 Kings 6-705/10/2015Study Guide 6.Getting God's Peace2 Kings 8-1005/17/2015Study Guide 7.Standing Firm When Heroes Die2 Kings 11-1205/24/2015Study Guide 8.Principles from a Good King2 Kings 13-1605/31/2015Study Guide 9.Warnings from a Just and Patient God2 Kings 1706/07/2015Study Guide 10.Don't Be So Full of Yourself2 Kings 18-2006/14/2015Study Guide 11.The Effect of God's Word2 Kings 21-2306/21/2015Study Guide 12.God Has Not Forsaken His People2 Kings 24-2506/28/2015Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"1Chronicles.html":{"url":"1Chronicles.html","title":"1 Chronicles","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

They faced great difficulties:\ntheir capital city and temple had been destroyed, foreigners had moved\nin, and they were no longer ruled by their own king. But the books of\nChronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah insist that God’s people can still\nfulfill his purpose. They must form a unique society centered on the\nworship of God in a rebuilt temple in Jerusalem. (These books are\nreally one long book, telling a continuous story; one can see, for\nexample, how the end of 2 Chronicles overlaps with the beginning of\nEzra.)\nThe book presents a sweeping chronicle of Israel’s history, beginning\nwith a long genealogy or ancestor list. Going all the way back to\nAdam, it situates the people of Israel among the nations and reminds\nthem of their calling. Special attention is given to Judah, ancestor\nof the royal line of David, and to Levi, ancestor of the priests and\ntemple attendants.\nThe second main part describes the kings who ruled in Jerusalem down\nto the time of the exile. David receives more attention than others,\nbut many details of his life told elsewhere are left out. The focus is\non his military campaigns and his elaborate plans for the temple in\nJerusalem. The reason is clear when we see that David was not\npermitted to build the temple because he was a warrior. God wanted a\nman of peace to build the place where all nations would come to\npray. The honor therefore fell to David’s son Solomon. More space is\ndevoted to him than to any king besides David, describing his\nconstruction of the temple and the splendors of his reign.\nThe final part of the book relates the experiences of the returned\nexiles. The memoirs of Ezra and Nehemiah, leaders of the second\ngeneration of returned Judeans, are incorporated into the\nhistory. These leaders helped create a distinct community by\nforbidding intermarriage with the surrounding peoples, and they\ndirected the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls. Included here is a\ndescription of a great covenant renewal ceremony led by Ezra and\nNehemiah.\nAn important theme of the entire history—which can appropriately be\ncalled a temple history—is that pure worship is offered on God’s\nterms, not ours. God has chosen Israel to welcome the nations into\ntrue worship. Through all the ups and downs of history he is working\nto bring this purpose to fulfillment.\n\nBible Project\n\n1 Chronicles Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('12Chronicles_BP', '12Chronicles_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\nAs of 12/2023 Spoken Gospel has no Chronicles introduction\n\n2015 1 Chronicles Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Belonging1 Chronicles 1-1208/23/2015Study Guide 2.Doing Things God's Way1 Chronicles 13-1508/30/2015Study Guide 3.Ownership1 Chronicles 16-2909/06/2015Study Guide 1.Belonging1 Chronicles 1-1208/23/2015Study Guide 2.Doing Things God's Way1 Chronicles 13-1508/30/2015Study Guide 3.Ownership1 Chronicles 16-2909/06/2015Study Guide\n\n\n1 Chronicles Misc Selection\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.What are you counting?

Through all the ups and downs of history he is working\nto bring this purpose to fulfillment.\n\nBible Project\n\nNehemiah Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Ezra_Nehemiah_BP', 'Ezra_Nehemiah_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2016 Nehemiah Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Helping the Troubled and DisgracedNehemiah 101/10/2016Study Guide 2.Examining Our Gates: Jesus & EvangelismNehemiah 2-3:1-501/31/2016Study Guide 3.Examining Our Gates: Truth & TrialsNehemiah 3:6-1302/07/2016Study Guide 4.Examining Our Gates: SinNehemiah 3:13-1402/14/2016Study Guide 5.Examining Our Gates: the Holy SpiritNehemiah 3:1502/21/2016Study Guide 6.Examining Our Gates: the BibleNehemiah 3:2602/28/2016Study Guide 7.Examining Our Gates: Spiritual WarfareNehemiah 3:2803/06/2016Study Guide 8.Examining Our Gates:The Second Coming of Christ and Judgment DayNehemiah 3:29-3203/13/2016Study Guide 9.Fight for Your Family!Nehemiah 404/03/2016Study Guide 10.Being Others-OrientedNehemiah 504/10/2016Study Guide 11.Patient PerseveranceNehemiah 604/17/2016Study Guide 12.Building up our Spiritual WallsNehemiah 7-1004/24/2016Study Guide 13.The Test of TimeNehemiah 11-1305/01/2016Study Guide 1.Helping the Troubled and DisgracedNehemiah 101/10/2016Study Guide 2.Examining Our Gates: Jesus & EvangelismNehemiah 2-3:1-501/31/2016Study Guide 3.Examining Our Gates: Truth & TrialsNehemiah 3:6-1302/07/2016Study Guide 4.Examining Our Gates: SinNehemiah 3:13-1402/14/2016Study Guide 5.Examining Our Gates: the Holy SpiritNehemiah 3:1502/21/2016Study Guide 6.Examining Our Gates: the BibleNehemiah 3:2602/28/2016Study Guide 7.Examining Our Gates: Spiritual WarfareNehemiah 3:2803/06/2016Study Guide 8.Examining Our Gates:The Second Coming of Christ and Judgment DayNehemiah 3:29-3203/13/2016Study Guide 9.Fight for Your Family!Nehemiah 404/03/2016Study Guide 10.Being Others-OrientedNehemiah 504/10/2016Study Guide 11.Patient PerseveranceNehemiah 604/17/2016Study Guide 12.Building up our Spiritual WallsNehemiah 7-1004/24/2016Study Guide 13.The Test of TimeNehemiah 11-1305/01/2016Study Guide\n\n\nNehemiah Misc Selection\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Opposition is Coming: Are You Prepared?

But despite this fact, God is always working to turn the plans of\nthe enemy upside down. God's people are enslaved to the Persian Empire\nand under threat from its genocidal Prime Minister, Haman. Israel's\nbest hope is in the relatively powerless Esther and Mordecai. But God\nuses these powerless people to turn back the plans of the\npowerful. Ultimately, Esther reveals to us the Savior who not only\nbecame powerless but died and turned even the power of the grave\nupside down.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2016 Esther Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Esther Introduction\n\nThe book of Esther explains why Jews in the Persian period began\ncelebrating a new festival called Purim. The law of Moses had earlier\ndescribed how God’s mighty acts of deliverance lay behind holidays\nsuch as Passover and Tabernacles. The book of Esther shows how God\nintervened once again to save the Jews, leading to a commemoration of\nthis great rescue in the feast of Purim.\nThis fast-moving story occurs during the reign of the Persian king\nXerxes (most likely Xerxes I, 486–465 BC). It relates the adventures\nthat take place when a Jewish exile named Esther and her cousin and\nguardian Mordecai work to rescue their people from a plot to destroy\nthem. While the story never mentions God by name, God’s hand of\nprotection can be detected in the timing and combination of events as\nthey unfold.\nThe book features numerous banquets, including two hosted by Xerxes at\nthe beginning, two given by Esther in the middle, and two celebrated\nby the grateful Jews at the end. Since this story was told to later\ngenerations during the feast of Purim itself, the audience is placed\nright in the middle of the action. Those who read it can not only join\nin celebrating God’s deliverance, they can ask themselves, as Mordecai\nasked Esther, for what great purpose God may have brought them to\ntheir own position in life.\n\nBible Project\n\nEsther Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Esther_BP', 'Esther_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2016 Esther Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.The Dignity of WomenEsther 105/08/2016Study Guide 2.The Misery of our GloryEsther 205/22/2016Study Guide 3.For Such a Time as ThisEsther 3-405/29/2016Study Guide 4.When Plans BackfireEsther 5-706/05/2016Study Guide 5.Turning the TablesEsther 8-1006/12/2016Study Guide 1.The Dignity of WomenEsther 105/08/2016Study Guide 2.The Misery of our GloryEsther 205/22/2016Study Guide 3.For Such a Time as ThisEsther 3-405/29/2016Study Guide 4.When Plans BackfireEsther 5-706/05/2016Study Guide 5.Turning the TablesEsther 8-1006/12/2016Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Job.html":{"url":"Job.html","title":"Job","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Why do bad things happen to good\npeople? What is the relationship between God, suffering, and sin?\nThese are some of the most difficult questions raised about and\nagainst Christianity.\nThe book of Job takes them head-on but may not give us the answers we\nwant. The majority of Job shows us so many of the wrong ways to\nexplain why we suffer and what God's role is in it. The main answer\nJob does provide is that, in suffering, God is doing something beyond\nwhat our minds and logic can grasp. While we cannot get all the\nanswers we want to why we suffer, Job tells us that God is worth\ntrusting through it.\nUltimately, Job points us to Jesus. Job's friends tried to blame Job\nfor suffering, while Job eventually ends up blaming God. Neither\nsolutions are correct. Nevertheless, even though we are to blame for\nmuch of the suffering we and others experience because of our sin,\nJesus takes the blame for it on the cross. Jesus suffered, taking the\npain and blame our sins deserved, to show us that God is truly doing\nsomething through suffering that we cannot comprehend. He saved the\nworld by suffering on the cross.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2016 Job Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Job Introduction\n\nThe wisdom of Proverbs describes how godly character generally leads\nto success. Ecclesiastes tempers this, warning that rewards are not\nguaranteed, since a kind of “crookedness” has come into our world. The\nbook of Job goes further, exploring how righteous people sometimes\nsuffer. The book of Job uses a common literary device from the wisdom\ntraditions of the ancient world: an extended conversation based on\npoetic speeches.\nJob is introduced as a good man. But “the adversary” (satan in Hebrew)\npoints out an apparent problem in God’s moral oversight of the\nuniverse. If goodness is always rewarded, how can we know if it’s born\nfrom love of God or desire for gain? So God allows the adversary to\nbring suffering into Job’s life.\nJob doesn’t curse God as the adversary predicted but ends up debating\nwith three friends: Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar. Their overly rigid\nview of the moral universe convinces them that Job’s own wrongdoing\nhas caused his suffering. A young man Elihu joins the conversation\nlater, while Job continues to insist that he has done nothing wrong\nand deserves a hearing before God.\nFinally, God reveals the power and wisdom shown in his oversight of\ncreation. Job then humbly admits his own limited understanding. When\nGod rebukes Job’s three friends, we see they are guilty of a far worse\nassumption than Job. In the end God blesses Job with twice as much as\nhe had before. The book warns us to avoid reducing God’s moral rule to\neasy formulas.\n\nBible Project\n\nJob Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Job_BP', 'Job_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2016 Job Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Satan & SufferingJob 110/23/2016Study Guide 2.Friends & SufferingJob 2-1110/30/2016Study Guide 3.God & SufferingJob 12-3811/06/2016Study Guide 4.My Life & SufferingJob 39-4211/13/2016Study Guide 1.Satan & SufferingJob 110/23/2016Study Guide 2.Friends & SufferingJob 2-1110/30/2016Study Guide 3.God & SufferingJob 12-3811/06/2016Study Guide 4.My Life & SufferingJob 39-4211/13/2016Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Psalms.html":{"url":"Psalms.html","title":"Psalms","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

They spring from\nIsrael's history, when people like King David wrote inspired songs\ngiving thanks, repenting of sin, affirming God's promises, or asking\nfor help. The Psalms have been a source of hope, a guide for honest\nprayer, and a treasury of prophetic promises for God's people\nthroughout generations. Now, Jesus has fulfilled these Psalms and\ngiven them to his church, providing us with songs to sing while we\nwait in this earthly exile for his return.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2016-2017 Psalms Series (Sundays)\nPsalms Misc Selection\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Psalms Introduction\n\nThe book of Psalms is a collection of song lyrics. Like many songs,\nthey were first written in response to events in the lives of their\nauthors. Later, the whole community used them in worship. When Israel\nreturned from exile in Babylon many of the songs from over the\ncenturies were collected in the book of Psalms.\nThe book is structured into five parts marked off by the phrase,\nPraise be to the Lord… Amen and Amen!These five “books” remind the\nreader of the five books of Moses. Like the law, these song lyrics can\nbe read and studied for instruction. Psalm 1 emphasizes such\nmeditation and seems to have been placed first to make this point.\nThe five books also tell a three-part story of Israel’s redemption:\nmonarchy, exile and return. The psalms of King David dominate books\none and two. The beginning and ending of book three highlight Israel’s\nexile. The fourth book ends with a plea that God bring the exiled\npeople home. The fifth book declares that God has done just that. Now\nthe reason for the group of praise psalms at the end of the book is\napparent: God has been faithful, judging Israel in exile but then\nbringing the nation home again.\nThe book of Psalms thus operates at two levels: individually the songs\nexplore a wide variety of honest spiritual responses to God, while the\noverall collection tells, and celebrates, the work of God in history\nto save his people.\n\nBible Project\n\nPsalms Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Psalms_BP', 'Psalms_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2016-2017 Psalms Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.God's Recipe for a Blessed LifePsalms 111/27/2016Study Guide 2.A Majestic God Cares About YouPsalms 2-812/04/2016Study Guide 3.Showing Reverence for GodPsalms 9-1512/11/2016Study Guide 4.The Path of LifePsalms 1612/18/2016Study Guide 5.Trusting GodPsalms 17-2201/15/2017Study Guide 6.The Song of a Shepherd -

This effort is personified\nthrough two main characters: Lady Wisdom and Lady Folly. Those who\nlisten to Lady Wisdom escape death, receive wisdom, and walk in\nlife. However, those who listen to Lady Folly repeat the mistakes made\nby Adam and Eve, earning the same result - death.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2017 Proverbs Series (Sundays)\nProverbs Misc Selection\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Proverbs Introduction\n\nIsrael understood that the Creator had placed an order in his world\nthat could be discovered. The book of Proverbs captures these lessons\nin compact, memorable sayings passed down from the wisest among their\nelders. Many of them are from Solomon, a king renowned for his wisdom\n(see 1 Kings 4:29-34). These proverbs are especially designed to help\nyounger people avoid common pitfalls and find the path to prosperity,\nhealth and security.\nAfter a short section of teaching, wisdom itself, personified as a\nwoman, calls out to the simple and invites them to grow in\nknowledge. This section ends by presenting two banquets, one hosted by\nWisdom and one by Folly, illustrating the essential choice to be made\nin life. A collection of 375 proverbs of Solomon follows, reflecting\nthe numerical value of his name in Hebrew. (Hebrew letters were also\nused as numbers, so words had a value equal to the sum of their\nletters.) After some “sayings of the wise,” next is a collection of\nSolomon’s wisdom compiled by the men of Hezekiah, king of Judah. Here\nthe count is 130, equaling the value of Hezekiah’s name. The book\ncloses with sayings from Agur and Lemuel, ending with a poem whose 22\nparts begin with consecutive letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The\ncharacter qualities praised throughout the book are seen in a\ndescription of the ideal wife.\nThis rich book of short, pithy wisdom presents a consistent theme: the\nfear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.\n\nBible Project\n\nProverbs Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Proverbs_BP', 'Proverbs_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2017 Proverbs Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Proverbs Series (Part 1): WisdomProverbs11/19/2017Study Guide 2.Proverbs Series (Part 2): MoneyProverbs11/26/2017Study Guide 3.Proverbs Series (Part 3): SexualityProverbs12/03/2017Study Guide 4.Proverbs Series (Part 4): Friends & FamilyProverbs12/10/2017Study Guide 5.Proverbs Series (Part 5): SpeechProverbs12/17/2017Study Guide 6.Proverbs Series (Part 6): VicesProverbs01/07/2018Study Guide 7.Proverbs Series (Part 7): VirtuesProverbs01/21/2018Study Guide 1.Proverbs Series (Part 1): WisdomProverbs11/19/2017Study Guide 2.Proverbs Series (Part 2): MoneyProverbs11/26/2017Study Guide 3.Proverbs Series (Part 3): SexualityProverbs12/03/2017Study Guide 4.Proverbs Series (Part 4): Friends & FamilyProverbs12/10/2017Study Guide 5.Proverbs Series (Part 5): SpeechProverbs12/17/2017Study Guide 6.Proverbs Series (Part 6): VicesProverbs01/07/2018Study Guide 7.Proverbs Series (Part 7): VirtuesProverbs01/21/2018Study Guide\n\n\nProverbs Misc Selection\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Saul and David (Andy Wagner)Proverbs 1-309/21/2022 1.Saul and David (Andy Wagner)Proverbs 1-309/21/2022\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Ecclesiastes.html":{"url":"Ecclesiastes.html","title":"Ecclesiastes","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Ecclesiastes asks this and other\ndifficult questions but is unique in the way it answers them. The\nauthor of Ecclesiastes aims to show us how vain life \"under the sun\"\nis, despite anyone's most lofty attempts to make it meaningful. The\nonly solution Ecclesiastes offers us comes from above the sun - namely\nfrom God. Only when we see how God brings meaning into our lives\nthrough the revelation of Jesus can we interact with this world in a\nway that escapes vanity and builds meaning.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2018 Ecclesiastes Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Ecclesiastes Introduction\n\nEcclesiastes is the collected words of a “teacher” or “preacher.” The\nTeacher is described as having been king over Israel in Jerusalem, and\nas the son of David. Both of these mean that he was in the royal line\nof Judah. He is not further identified, and while tradition identifies\nhim with Solomon, it is appropriate to leave this cloak of anonymity\nin place.\nThe repeated phrase Meaningless! Meaningless! Everything is\nmeaningless! warns us that life’s rewards are uncertain and ultimately\nunsatisfying. The Teacher pursues this insight in a long discourse\nthat shifts between prose and poetry, and between autobiography and\nstraightforward teaching. The book makes observations and poses\nquestions, returning to themes like the wind— round and round it goes,\never returning on its course.\nWhen the Teacher says What is crooked cannot be straightened, he\nreminds us that something wrong has intruded into our world. This fits\nthe larger Jewish story told in the rest of the Scriptures. Setting\nthings right again is what this bigger drama is about. The Teacher,\nhowever, does not tell us about God’s attempts at straightening the\nworld. He is content to say that God is sovereign over all things and\nit is our duty to follow his ways for living, since God will bring\nevery deed into judgment.\n\nBible Project\n\nEcclesiastes Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Ecclesiastes_BP', 'Ecclesiastes_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2018 Ecclesiastes Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.A Full Life On EmptyEcclesiastes 101/28/2018Study Guide 2.On the Hunt for Happiness and SatisfactionEcclesiastes 202/04/2018Study Guide 3.The Temporal and the EternalEcclesiastes 302/11/2018Study Guide 4.Understanding Evil in Our WorldEcclesiastes 402/18/2018Study Guide 5.Right WorshipEcclesiastes 503/04/2018Study Guide 6.The Destiny of EternityEcclesiastes 6-903/11/2018Study Guide 7.A Fulfilled LifeEcclesiastes 11-1203/18/2018Study Guide 1.A Full Life On EmptyEcclesiastes 101/28/2018Study Guide 2.On the Hunt for Happiness and SatisfactionEcclesiastes 202/04/2018Study Guide 3.The Temporal and the EternalEcclesiastes 302/11/2018Study Guide 4.Understanding Evil in Our WorldEcclesiastes 402/18/2018Study Guide 5.Right WorshipEcclesiastes 503/04/2018Study Guide 6.The Destiny of EternityEcclesiastes 6-903/11/2018Study Guide 7.A Fulfilled LifeEcclesiastes 11-1203/18/2018Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"SongOfSolomon.html":{"url":"SongOfSolomon.html","title":"Song of Solomon","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

People often\nthink this book is only about sexual intimacy or only a metaphor for\nour relationship with God. The beauty of this song, and why it is the\ncalled the greatest song ever written, is that it is about both. Only\nwhen we are intimate with God can we be properly intimate with anyone\nelse. Only when we give holy love to others are we truly living in\nGod's holy love for us.\nUltimately, though, Song of Songs is about absence and longing. There\nare constant warnings to not awaken love until the proper time mixed\nwith seasons of the groom's absence that leave the bride desperate and\nalone. This longing is meant to frame what is our common experience of\nGod's presence. Yes, there are times of beautiful intimacy where we\nfeel close to God. But there are also seasons that seem to interrupt\nthat intimacy with doubt, absence, and a sense of longing.\nOur sense of longing and feelings of absence, shows us that God knows they\nexist and is drawing near to us to bring healing and satisfaction in\nthe person of Jesus.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2018 Song of Solomon Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Song of Solomon Introduction\n\nTraditional wedding celebrations in the Middle East cast the bride and\ngroom in the roles of a king and his queen. The festivities include\nlove songs and also special songs that praise the physical beauty of\nthe bride or the handsomeness of the groom. The custom has a long\nhistory and is reflected in the anthology of wedding songs we know as\nthe Song of Songs. The individual songs may have been used repeatedly\nin marriage celebrations and eventually gathered together, just as the\npsalms were collected after years of use in worship. The title\nSolomon’s Song of Songs can be taken to mean that King Solomon, a\nrenowned composer (see 1 Kings 4:29-34), was the author of its\nsongs. However, it could also be a reference to Solomon as the kind of\nglorious king the groom represents.\nThe songs are arranged to tell the courtship story of a man and woman,\nof their marriage (described as a royal wedding) and its consummation,\nand of the beginning of their new life together. After a short\nintroduction the book presents six episodes, each typically ending\nwith a reference to the friends of the man and woman. This may refer\nto others attending the wedding to join in the celebration. Together\nthe songs celebrate the delights of married love and the beauty of the\nhuman body, using vivid imagery from the natural world to show that\nthese things are part of the creation that God declared very good.\n\nBible Project\n\nSong of Solomon Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('SongOfSolomon_BP', 'SongOfSolomon_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2018 Song of Solomon Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Courtship LoveSong of Solomon 1-204/08/2018Study Guide 2.Marital LoveSong of Solomon 3-504/15/2018Study Guide 3.God's LoveSong of Solomon 6-804/22/2018Study Guide 1.Courtship LoveSong of Solomon 1-204/08/2018Study Guide 2.Marital LoveSong of Solomon 3-504/15/2018Study Guide 3.God's LoveSong of Solomon 6-804/22/2018Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Isaiah.html":{"url":"Isaiah.html","title":"Isaiah","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Because\nof their sin, God sent Babylon to judge Israel. But Isaiah's ministry\nheld out hope that God would save them through judgement. Isaiah told\nIsrael that she needed to trust God more than she trusted false gods\nand other kingdoms. Though Israel refused to heed Isaiah's warning,\nGod still chose to save her. And God saved Israel, not through judging\nthem, but by the suffering and judgment Jesus experienced on the\ncross.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2018 Isaiah Series (Sundays)\nIsaiah Misc Selection\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Isaiah Introduction\n\nThe prophet Isaiah addressed the kingdom of Judah for forty years,\nbeginning in the year that King Uzziah died (around 740 BC) and\ncontinuing at least to the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem in 701 BC. As\nwith all the prophets, Isaiah based his message on the deep covenant\nbond between God and his people Israel. Prophets typically delivered\ntheir messages by composing oracles—poetic speeches they recited in\npublic. Unlike some other prophets, Isaiah had personal access to the\nkings of his day. He was able to bring godly counsel to kings Ahaz and\nHezekiah when the powerful Assyrian Empire threatened the life of the\nnation. Isaiah maintains an international perspective throughout his\nbook, revealing that Israel’s life is bound up with the affairs of the\nbroader world.\nIsaiah urges the people to care for the poor and needy, commit to\nfollow God’s ways, and pursue social and economic justice. In typical\nprophetic pattern, he speaks of coming judgment because of Israel’s\nfailure, but also of promised restoration, and moving from Israel to\nthe wider world. God’s correction is in the service of\nrenewal. Isaiah’s later oracles introduce the complex figure of the\nservant, whose personal sacrifice brings healing. These “servant\nsongs” fit into the bigger picture of Israel’s return from exile, the\nLord’s return to his people, and the nations turning to God. New\nTestament writers will turn to Isaiah often to explain how Israel’s\nancient commission to bring blessing to the world was fulfilled.\n\nBible Project\n\nIsaiah Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Isaiah_BP', 'Isaiah_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\nPart 1: Isaiah 1-13 ...\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Isaiah 14-28\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2018 Isaiah Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Let's Reason TogetherIsaiah 1-504/29/2018Study Guide 2.God's CallingIsaiah 605/06/2018Study Guide 3.Mission Messiah: Jesus is BornIsaiah 7-905/13/2018Study Guide 4.Who Is Satan?Isaiah 1405/20/2018Study Guide 5.Perfect PeaceIsaiah 24-2705/27/2018Study Guide 6.Jesus Our CornerstoneIsaiah 2806/03/2018Study Guide 7.All Talk but No WalkIsaiah 2906/10/2018Study Guide 8.God is Waiting for YouIsaiah 30-3106/17/2018Study Guide 9.Out of the DesertIsaiah 31-3506/24/2018Study Guide 10.Why Pray?Isaiah 36-3807/01/2018Study Guide 11.A Tale of Two GloriesIsaiah 39-4007/22/2018Study Guide 12.Don't Be AfraidIsaiah 41-4307/29/2018Study Guide 13.Forget the PastIsaiah 4308/05/2018Study Guide 14.The One True GodIsaiah 44-4908/12/2018Study Guide 15.Jesus the MessiahIsaiah 50-5308/19/2018Study Guide 16.Seek the LordIsaiah 54-5508/26/2018Study Guide 17.All Are WelcomeIsaiah 5609/02/2018Study Guide 18.Soul-Fattening: The Discipline of FastingIsaiah 5809/09/2018Study Guide 19.The Year of the Lord's FavorIsaiah 6109/30/2018Study Guide 20.The Truth about the Human ConditionIsaiah 6410/07/2018Study Guide 21.5 Marks of the MillenniumIsaiah 6510/14/2018Study Guide 1.Let's Reason TogetherIsaiah 1-504/29/2018Study Guide 2.God's CallingIsaiah 605/06/2018Study Guide 3.Mission Messiah: Jesus is BornIsaiah 7-905/13/2018Study Guide 4.Who Is Satan?Isaiah 1405/20/2018Study Guide 5.Perfect PeaceIsaiah 24-2705/27/2018Study Guide 6.Jesus Our CornerstoneIsaiah 2806/03/2018Study Guide 7.All Talk but No WalkIsaiah 2906/10/2018Study Guide 8.God is Waiting for YouIsaiah 30-3106/17/2018Study Guide 9.Out of the DesertIsaiah 31-3506/24/2018Study Guide 10.Why Pray?Isaiah 36-3807/01/2018Study Guide 11.A Tale of Two GloriesIsaiah 39-4007/22/2018Study Guide 12.Don't Be AfraidIsaiah 41-4307/29/2018Study Guide 13.Forget the PastIsaiah 4308/05/2018Study Guide 14.The One True GodIsaiah 44-4908/12/2018Study Guide 15.Jesus the MessiahIsaiah 50-5308/19/2018Study Guide 16.Seek the LordIsaiah 54-5508/26/2018Study Guide 17.All Are WelcomeIsaiah 5609/02/2018Study Guide 18.Soul-Fattening: The Discipline of FastingIsaiah 5809/09/2018Study Guide 19.The Year of the Lord's FavorIsaiah 6109/30/2018Study Guide 20.The Truth about the Human ConditionIsaiah 6410/07/2018Study Guide 21.5 Marks of the MillenniumIsaiah 6510/14/2018Study Guide\n\n\nIsaiah Misc Selection\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Is Atheism Dead?

God vowed to be\nfaithful, and Israel promised to be lovingly his. But Israel\nrepeatedly broke her marriage vows. She sacrificed to false gods; she\neven killed her own children in their rituals. Jeremiah called Israel\na whore for this idolatry. When Israel worshiped other gods she was\nreally committing adultery and Jeremiah begged for her to return and\nrepent.\nBut Israel wouldn't listen, she chose to break her vows and her\ncovenant with God. But God promised that he would be a faithful\nhusband to his adulterous bride.

We are given an intimate look into the prophet’s own\nheart as he brings God’s message to his fellow Judeans, who reject him\nand even conspire to kill him.\nThe book begins and ends with historical references to the event\nJeremiah was best known for predicting: the fall of Jerusalem. The\nfour main parts generally consist (in order) of oracles, narratives\n(two sections), and then oracles. Significantly, each of these four\nparts ends with a reference to Jeremiah’s words being written in a\nbook or scroll. A long poetic oracle is inserted in the middle\nnarrative of the book. So Jeremiah’s prophecies appear at the\nbeginning, middle and end of the book, highlighting their\nimportance. The middle oracle, promising a new covenant designed to\nchange the human heart, is shown to be the most important of all. God\nwill do more than simply punish evil—he will overcome it with good.\nThe book of Jeremiah carries us back and forth in place and time as we\nturn its pages, yet its themes are consistent. The message of judgment\nfor wrongdoing is followed by the restorative power of forgiveness and\nnew life: to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build\nand to plant.\n\nBible Project\n\nJeremiah Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Jeremiah_BP', 'Jeremiah_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2019 Jeremiah Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Broken CisternsJeremiah 1-210/21/2018Study Guide 2.A Serious WoundJeremiah 3-610/28/2018Study Guide 3.Wisdom for the CrossroadsJeremiah 6:1611/04/2018Study Guide 4.Something to Boast AboutJeremiah 7-911/11/2018Study Guide 5.A Prayer for Idol HeartsJeremiah 1011/18/2018Study Guide 6.The Right Way to See a Wrong WorldJeremiah 11-1211/25/2018Study Guide 7.A Life that Bears God's NameJeremiah 13-1512/02/2018Study Guide 8.A Change of HeartJeremiah 16-1701/06/2019Study Guide 9.Sanctity of Human LifeJeremiah 18-1901/20/2019Study Guide 10.Good Things Out of a Bad PlaceJeremiah 2401/27/2019Study Guide 11.Stand for What is RightJeremiah 25-2602/03/2019Study Guide 12.RestorationJeremiah 29-3102/10/2019Study Guide 13.A Principled LifeJeremiah 3502/17/2019Study Guide 14.Don't Lose Sight of GodJeremiah 36-3902/24/2019Study Guide 15.The RemnantJeremiah 40-4203/03/2019Study Guide 16.Courage for the DiscouragedJeremiah 4503/10/2019Study Guide 17.Don't \"Wine\" About ItJeremiah 46-4803/17/2019Study Guide 18.Lessons from BabylonJeremiah 49-5203/31/2019Study Guide 1.Broken CisternsJeremiah 1-210/21/2018Study Guide 2.A Serious WoundJeremiah 3-610/28/2018Study Guide 3.Wisdom for the CrossroadsJeremiah 6:1611/04/2018Study Guide 4.Something to Boast AboutJeremiah 7-911/11/2018Study Guide 5.A Prayer for Idol HeartsJeremiah 1011/18/2018Study Guide 6.The Right Way to See a Wrong WorldJeremiah 11-1211/25/2018Study Guide 7.A Life that Bears God's NameJeremiah 13-1512/02/2018Study Guide 8.A Change of HeartJeremiah 16-1701/06/2019Study Guide 9.Sanctity of Human LifeJeremiah 18-1901/20/2019Study Guide 10.Good Things Out of a Bad PlaceJeremiah 2401/27/2019Study Guide 11.Stand for What is RightJeremiah 25-2602/03/2019Study Guide 12.RestorationJeremiah 29-3102/10/2019Study Guide 13.A Principled LifeJeremiah 3502/17/2019Study Guide 14.Don't Lose Sight of GodJeremiah 36-3902/24/2019Study Guide 15.The RemnantJeremiah 40-4203/03/2019Study Guide 16.Courage for the DiscouragedJeremiah 4503/10/2019Study Guide 17.Don't \"Wine\" About ItJeremiah 46-4803/17/2019Study Guide 18.Lessons from BabylonJeremiah 49-5203/31/2019Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Lamentations.html":{"url":"Lamentations.html","title":"Lamentations","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

But instead of mourning a loved one's\npassing, this book laments over the death of Israel and her\ntemple. The mourners admit they are responsible for Israel's demise\nand they grieve the possibility that they have been utterly rejected\nby God. But in the middle of their grief, there is a message of\nhope–God's mercies are new every morning!\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2019 Lamentations Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Lamentations Introduction\n\nWhen the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem and deported much of its\npopulation, some residents were left behind in terrible conditions in\nand around the shattered city. To express their deep shame and grief\nover the destruction of their home, they wrote songs about its\ndesolation and about the sufferings they were witnessing and\nexperiencing. The book of Lamentations does not tell us who wrote\nthese songs, although tradition ascribes them to Jeremiah. Here we\nwitness people of faith putting into words their struggle to\nunderstand how God could have allowed the city they loved to be so\ndevastated.\nEach of the five songs preserved in the book has 22 stanzas. The first\nfour songs begin with the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet in\nconsecutive order. In the third song the letters are repeated at the\nstart of each of the three lines in the stanza. There are few\nexpressions of hope, but they are placed in the center of the book to\ngive them extra prominence in a situation where they are badly\nneeded. Overall, this collection of laments reminds us that expressing\nanguish over a broken, fallen world is a legitimate part of the\nbiblical drama.\n\nBible Project\n\nLamentations Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Lamentations_BP', 'Lamentations_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2019 Lamentations Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Every Morning is Another ChanceLamentations 1-504/07/2019Study Guide 1.Every Morning is Another ChanceLamentations 1-504/07/2019Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Ezekiel.html":{"url":"Ezekiel.html","title":"Ezekiel","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Eventually, the temple will be destroyed, and it's Ezekiel's\njob to explain why.\nWhile the people of Israel were quick to assume God abandoned his\npeople and that their enemies overpowered him, they're wrong. Ezekiel\nsays both Israel's exile and the temple's destruction were God's\ndoing. God was punishing Israel for their sins. But Ezekiel also\nprophecies about a future hope where God would return Israel to her\nland, give her a new heart, and live with her forever.\nThe good news is that the hope that Ezekiel prophesied has come true\nin Jesus!\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2019 Ezekiel Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Ezekiel Introduction\n\nThe priest Ezekiel was among the Judeans that Nebuchadnezzar brought\nto Babylon in 597 BC. Five years into this exile, God called Ezekiel\nto go to Israel (both those in Babylon and those back in Judea) and\nspeak my words to them. Ezekiel often brought this message by composing\nfinely polished poetic oracles and speaking (or perhaps singing) them\nin public. But he also told stories with symbolic meanings, performed\nsymbolic actions, and described extraordinary visions that he had\nreceived.\nThe book of Ezekiel organizes these messages into three main parts:\noracles of judgment against Israel, oracles against other nations, and\nthen promises of Israel’s restoration. These divisions are marked by\nreferences to the prophet losing and then regaining his ability to\nspeak. A key vision near the beginning describes how God removed his\npresence from the Jerusalem temple because of Israel’s evil. The\noracles against the nations make it clear that though God’s temple was\ndestroyed, no one should conclude that God is not still in control of\nthe world. Those who threaten his people will be defeated in the\nend. The book’s closing promises confirm that God will renew the\nhearts of his people and refresh all life on the face of the\nearth. Ezekiel’s visions fit the ongoing drama of the Bible: a broken\nworld will be healed when the Lord returns to live with his people in\na land that has become like the garden of Eden.\n\nBible Project\n\nEzekiel Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Ezekiel_BP', 'Ezekiel_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\nPart 1: Ezekiel 1-33 ...\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Ezekiel 34-48\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2019 Ezekiel Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.The Theology of ResponsibilityEzekiel 1-304/28/2019Study Guide 2.Harnessing Our Thought LifeEzekiel 4-805/05/2019Study Guide 3.When God Heals a Hard HeartEzekiel 9-1105/12/2019Study Guide 4.God is Better than FairEzekiel 1806/02/2019Study Guide 5.Stand in the GapEzekiel 2206/16/2019Study Guide 6.Know Your EnemyEzekiel 2806/30/2019Study Guide 7.Losing Sin WeightEzekiel 3307/21/2019Study Guide 8.Israel and the End Times - Part 1Ezekiel 36-3708/04/2019Study Guide 9.Israel and the End Times – Part 2Ezekiel 38-3908/18/2019Study Guide 10.Israel and the End Times – Part 3Ezekiel 40-4808/25/2019Study Guide 1.The Theology of ResponsibilityEzekiel 1-304/28/2019Study Guide 2.Harnessing Our Thought LifeEzekiel 4-805/05/2019Study Guide 3.When God Heals a Hard HeartEzekiel 9-1105/12/2019Study Guide 4.God is Better than FairEzekiel 1806/02/2019Study Guide 5.Stand in the GapEzekiel 2206/16/2019Study Guide 6.Know Your EnemyEzekiel 2806/30/2019Study Guide 7.Losing Sin WeightEzekiel 3307/21/2019Study Guide 8.Israel and the End Times - Part 1Ezekiel 36-3708/04/2019Study Guide 9.Israel and the End Times – Part 2Ezekiel 38-3908/18/2019Study Guide 10.Israel and the End Times – Part 3Ezekiel 40-4808/25/2019Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Daniel.html":{"url":"Daniel.html","title":"Daniel","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

And yes ... there’s a famous story about a lion’s den.\nIsaiah was right. Jeremiah was right. Habakkuk was right. The\nBabylonians had attacked Jerusalem and carried off many Jewish\ncaptives. One of them was a young man named Daniel.\nWhat does it look like to be faithful in the midst of exile? The book\nof Daniel offers a surprising and relevant answer.  It is a glimpse of\nGod’s plan to restore his people and remain faithful to them no matter\nthe circumstances.\nDaniel’s prophetic visions offer hope that God will bring all nations\nunder his rule.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2012 Daniel Series (Mid Week)\n2019 Daniel Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Daniel Introduction\n\nThe book of Daniel combines two types of literature: court narrative\nand apocalypse. The opening narrative section presents six stories of\nhow God protected and promoted four young men who were taken into\nexile in Babylon. When Daniel and his friends Shadrach, Meshach and\nAbednego demonstrate their faithfulness to God, they are delivered\nfrom deadly perils by God’s mighty acts. Daniel was given the ability\nto interpret dreams, earning him a valued place in the royal court of\nBabylon, and later in the Persian Empire.\nThe second part of the book describes visions and messages Daniel\nreceived from God through angelic messengers. These visions are\npresented in the cryptic language and symbolic terms typical of\napocalyptic literature. Within them we see the outlines of Near\nEastern history: the empires of Babylon and Persia; the conquests of\nAlexander the Great; and the ongoing strife between the Ptolemys in\nEgypt and the Seleucids in Syria. The visions anticipate an arrogant\nruler, the Seleucid emperor Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who desecrated the\nJerusalem temple in 167 BC. This led to the Maccabean revolt, which\nrestored the nation’s independence and preserved the worship of\nIsrael’s God.\nThe visions in Daniel can also be understood to reveal the conditions\nat the end of the present age, showing it to be a time of definitive\nconflict between God’s people and their enemies. The people of God\nwill be sustained through their persecutions knowing they will receive\nthe kingdom.\n\nBible Project\n\nDaniel Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Daniel_BP', 'Daniel_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2012 Daniel Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingDaniel 101/25/2012 2.TeachingDaniel 202/01/2012 3.TeachingDaniel 302/08/2012 4.TeachingDaniel 402/15/2012 5.TeachingDaniel 502/22/2012 6.TeachingDaniel 602/29/2012 7.TeachingDaniel 703/07/2012 8.TeachingDaniel 803/14/2012 9.TeachingDaniel 903/21/2012 10.TeachingDaniel 1003/28/2012 11.TeachingDaniel 1104/11/2012 12.TeachingDaniel 11-1204/18/2012 1.TeachingDaniel 101/25/2012 2.TeachingDaniel 202/01/2012 3.TeachingDaniel 302/08/2012 4.TeachingDaniel 402/15/2012 5.TeachingDaniel 502/22/2012 6.TeachingDaniel 602/29/2012 7.TeachingDaniel 703/07/2012 8.TeachingDaniel 803/14/2012 9.TeachingDaniel 903/21/2012 10.TeachingDaniel 1003/28/2012 11.TeachingDaniel 1104/11/2012 12.TeachingDaniel 11-1204/18/2012\n\n\n2019 Daniel Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Standing Strong in a Wayward WorldDaniel 1:1-809/01/2019Study Guide 2.Faithfulness RewardedDaniel 1:8-2109/08/2019Study Guide 3.Kings and KingdomsDaniel 209/15/2019Study Guide 4.True FaithDaniel 309/22/2019Study Guide 5.Who is King of Your Life?Daniel 409/29/2019Study Guide 6.When God Weighs UsDaniel 510/06/2019Study Guide 7.Lessons from the Lions’ DenDaniel 610/13/2019Study Guide 8.The Coming AntichristDaniel 7-810/20/2019Study Guide 9.God’s Kindness Leads us to RepentanceDaniel 910/27/2019Study Guide 10.5 Things That Hinder Our PrayersDaniel 1011/03/2019Study Guide 11.The End TimesDaniel 11-1211/10/2019Study Guide 1.Standing Strong in a Wayward WorldDaniel 1:1-809/01/2019Study Guide 2.Faithfulness RewardedDaniel 1:8-2109/08/2019Study Guide 3.Kings and KingdomsDaniel 209/15/2019Study Guide 4.True FaithDaniel 309/22/2019Study Guide 5.Who is King of Your Life?Daniel 409/29/2019Study Guide 6.When God Weighs UsDaniel 510/06/2019Study Guide 7.Lessons from the Lions’ DenDaniel 610/13/2019Study Guide 8.The Coming AntichristDaniel 7-810/20/2019Study Guide 9.God’s Kindness Leads us to RepentanceDaniel 910/27/2019Study Guide 10.5 Things That Hinder Our PrayersDaniel 1011/03/2019Study Guide 11.The End TimesDaniel 11-1211/10/2019Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Hosea.html":{"url":"Hosea.html","title":"Hosea","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

God is angry. The prophet Hosea calls this type of idolatrous\nforeign policy \"adultery.\" So the book of Hosea asks an unsettling\nquestion: \"What will God do when his bride becomes a whore?\" But the\nbook of Hosea also gives a disturbingly gracious answer: \"God's\ncompassion is far hotter than his wrath.\" See how Hosea points us to\nJesus as the husband who buys us out of our political adultery and\nloves us with great compassion.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\nHosea Series\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Hosea Introduction\n\nThe prophet Hosea spoke to the northern kingdom of Israel in the\nturbulent period of the 8th century BC. Following the death of Jeroboam\nII, Israel had six different kings in just over twenty years; four\nwere assassinated and the last was forcibly removed from the\nthrone. The rising empire of Assyria invaded Israel, and by 722 BC had\ncompletely conquered the nation and carried off much of its population\ninto exile.\nIsrael had made the mistake of identifying the Lord with Baal, a\nCanaanite nature god. This identification may have begun innocently\nenough, since baal simply means “master.” But by the time of Hosea, the\npeople were visiting shrine prostitutes, and had adopted the magical\npractices of fertility cults. Hosea repeatedly denounces this\ncorrupted worship as spiritual prostitution. He also condemns the\nnation’s foolish foreign intrigues, its rejection of the moral law,\nand its callous greed. The people dismissed Hosea’s warnings, however,\nand simply mocked him.\nThe book is structured into two main parts. The shorter first part\ntells how God commanded Hosea to marry the unfaithful woman Gomer. She\nis symbolic of Israel’s wavering faithfulness to the Lord.

The specific occasion\nof the book, however, is very clear and Joel uses this occasion to\ndeliver a powerful spiritual message.\nThe book begins by graphically describing how a swarm of locusts has\noverrun the land of Judah and eaten everything in sight. After calling\nfor the people to repent in response to this disaster, the book offers\na detailed description of the locust swarm itself. The locusts are\nlike an invading army, with God at their head. Joel asserts that the\nday of the Lord—a day of judgment—has come. He renews his call for\nrepentance through fasting, community prayer and heartfelt\ncontrition. In response, he promises that God will not only drive the\nlocusts away, but restore more than they have devoured. He foretells\nGod’s defeat of all the nations that oppose his people, and how God\nwill pour out his Spirit on the survivors in Judah. If the people\nreturn to the Lord with all of their hearts, they will see the return\nof their prosperity when the day of the Lord arrives.\n\nBible Project\n\nJoel Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Joel_BP', 'Joel_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2012 Joel Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingJoel 106/20/2012 2.TeachingJoel 2-306/27/2012 1.TeachingJoel 106/20/2012 2.TeachingJoel 2-306/27/2012\n\n\n2019 Joel Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.When God RelentsJoel 1-311/24/2019Study Guide 1.When God RelentsJoel 1-311/24/2019Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Amos.html":{"url":"Amos.html","title":"Amos","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Though the kingdom has seen military success and\nprosperity, they are spiritually bankrupt. They have totally ignored\nthe commands of the covenant and have instead begun worshiping pagan\ngods and losing sight of their call to live righteously and represent\nYahweh to the nations. They have become infamous for cheating,\nstealing, and oppressing the poor in their community. Is there any\nhope for Israel?\nOne Last Chance\nGod is grieved by how far Israel has fallen. But Yahweh is a merciful\nGod, and he gives them one last chance to turn back to covenant\nfaithfulness. God doesn't want empty religious practices from his\npeople. He wants to see his love for people reflected through the\nIsraelites and faithfulness to Yahweh alone, but this can only come\nthrough renewed hearts.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\nAmos Series\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Amos Introduction\n\nThe northern kingdom of Israel reached its greatest heights in the\nfirst half of the 8th century BC (2 Kings 14:23-25), during the\nforty-one-year reign of the powerful Jeroboam II. Confident in their\nnation’s victories, their worship, and their heritage, the people\nadopted the motto, “God is with us!” They were anticipating the day of\nthe Lord, when God would strike down all their enemies and establish\nIsrael as the undisputed ruler of the region.\nInto this atmosphere of overconfident nationalism steps Amos, a\nshepherd from the southern kingdom of Judah. He stands in the great\nroyal temple at Bethel and announces that God is stirring up a nation\nto conquer Israel. The day of the Lord, he insisted, will be darkness,\nnot light. God isn’t impressed with Israel’s wealth, military might,\nor self-indulgent way of life. He is looking for justice, while the\nrich and powerful are taking advantage of the poor. God is calling\nIsrael to repentance as the only way to avoid destruction.\nThe message causes an uproar. Amaziah, the high priest at Bethel,\naccuses Amos of treason. Amos is banished from the kingdom, but his\noracles are recorded, creating one of the earliest collections we have\nfrom any Hebrew prophet. The book consists of roughly three dozen\nseparate oracles, plus the story of his expulsion. Most of the book is\nloosely assembled, but it conveys one strong and consistent message:\nLet justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing\nstream!\n\nBible Project\n\nAmos Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Amos_BP', 'Amos_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAmos Series\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingAMOS 1-307/25/2012 2.TeachingAMOS 4-608/01/2012 3.TeachingAMOS 7-908/15/2012 4.Vertically True in a Crooked WorldAMOS12/08/2019Study Guide 1.TeachingAMOS 1-307/25/2012 2.TeachingAMOS 4-608/01/2012 3.TeachingAMOS 7-908/15/2012 4.Vertically True in a Crooked WorldAMOS12/08/2019Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Obadiah.html":{"url":"Obadiah.html","title":"Obadiah","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

He runs from his calling at every turn, showing\nlittle faith in Yahweh. But eventually he goes to the nation of\nNineveh to deliver God’s message. This is where things start to get\nconfusing.\nDespite Jonah’s warning having the intended effect—Nineveh turning in\nrepentance to Yahweh—Jonah is furious with God for sparing the\nNinevites. What is going on in this story? There’s a lot to unpack,\nand it’s probably a lot different than what you learned in Sunday\nschool.\nWhat can we learn from Jonah?\nThe story of Joanh recounts remarkable experiences with storms at sea,\nbeing eaten by a fish, and plants that miraculously grow and die in a\nday, and the lessons behind these images go much deeper than what is\non the surface.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\nJonah Series\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Jonah Introduction\n\nThe book relates how the word of the Lord came to Jonah, a prophet\nduring the reign of Jeroboam II in the 8th century BC. It is unique\namong prophetic books in focusing on a story about a prophet rather\nthan a collection of oracles. The book contains only a single sentence\nof prophecy.\nThe story concerns God’s call to Jonah to warn the people of Nineveh\nof its coming destruction. The book is structured into two main acts\nwith two scenes each. The repetition of God’s command to Go to the\ngreat city of Nineveh marks the beginning of each act. The first scene\nis set on a ship as Jonah tries to avoid his mission. The second scene\ntakes place in the belly of a huge fish which has swallowed Jonah. In\nthe second act both scenes are associated with Nineveh itself, the\nfirst within the city as Jonah preaches and Nineveh repents, the\nsecond just outside the city as Jonah struggles with God’s mercy.\nJonah’s role in the book is to represent the attitude of many in\nIsrael toward other nations. Instead of accepting their own calling to\nhelp these nations come to know the true God, they considered them\nenemies and expected God to destroy them. The book teaches that God’s\nlove extends beyond Israel to other nations, indeed, to the whole\ncreation. God’s final question to Jonah is intended for all the book’s\nreaders.\n\nBible Project\n\nJonah Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Jonah_BP', 'Jonah_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nJonah Series\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingJONAH 108/29/2012 2.TeachingJONAH 209/05/2012 3.TeachingJONAH 3-409/12/2012 4.The Mercy of GodJONAH01/05/2020Study Guide 1.TeachingJONAH 108/29/2012 2.TeachingJONAH 209/05/2012 3.TeachingJONAH 3-409/12/2012 4.The Mercy of GodJONAH01/05/2020Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Micah.html":{"url":"Micah.html","title":"Micah","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Micah then laments for his people\nbecause he knows Israel must pay for her sin, and that Jerusalem will\nsoon fall. Jesus embodies the judgment of Micah, even to the point of\ndeath. Ultimately, Micah reveals to us that in Jesus’ death, there is\nthe hope of a new Kingdom.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\nMicah Series\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Micah Introduction\n\nThe prophet Micah speaks to the southern kingdom of Judah during the\nreigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah (late 8th century BC). He foresees\nthat Samaria and Jerusalem, the capital cities of Israel and Judah,\nwill be destroyed because of their injustice and corrupt religion. The\npeople have abandoned the covenant God made with them, taking up the\npagan religious practices of the Canaanites. The rich and powerful are\nruthlessly exploiting the poor, ignoring the law of Moses. Micah warns\nthat in punishment for their unfaithfulness and injustice, both\nkingdoms will be invaded, conquered and exiled. As he predicts,\nSamaria falls to the Assyrians in 722 BC and Jerusalem falls to the\nBabylonians in 587/6 BC.\nMicah’s prophecies alternate between warnings of destruction and\npromises of restoration. Each of Micah’s three groups of oracles\nbegins with a series of judgments, and then concludes with promises of\nrestoration. Micah proclaims that in compassion and covenant\nfaithfulness God will save a remnant of the people and bring them back\nto their own land. There they will be ruled by a righteous king and\nbecome a light to the whole world, pointing all nations to the ways of\nthe Lord. God will help Israel find its place in the biblical drama.\n\nBible Project\n\nMicah Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Micah_BP', 'Micah_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nMicah Series\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingMICAH 1-209/19/2012 2.TeachingMICAH 3-409/26/2012 3.TeachingMICAH 5-710/10/2012 4.The Sea of ForgetfulnessMICAH01/12/2020Study Guide 1.TeachingMICAH 1-209/19/2012 2.TeachingMICAH 3-409/26/2012 3.TeachingMICAH 5-710/10/2012 4.The Sea of ForgetfulnessMICAH01/12/2020Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Nahum.html":{"url":"Nahum.html","title":"Nahum","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Referencing Daniel, Exodus, and\nIsaiah, Nahum shows us that the destruction of Nineveh and Assyria are\nexamples of how God works in history in every age.\nThe destruction of the Assyrian empire is an image of how God will\nconfront and bring down all violent human empires. This is about God’s\ncommitment to justice, which is as true today as it was in the time of\nNahum. While God will defeat human evil, he does not forget the\ninnocent. He promises to provide a refuge on the day of judgment for\nanyone who humbles themselves before God.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2012 Nahum Series (Mid Week)\n2020 Nahum Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Nahum Introduction\n\nIn 612 BC the Assyrian Empire was nearing collapse. Its capital\nNineveh was about to fall before a combined invasion of Babylonian,\nMedean and Scythian forces. But those living in the nations that\nAssyria had cruelly oppressed felt little pity. In their view, the\nAssyrians were simply getting a long-overdue taste of their own\nmedicine. The prophet Nahum echoes these thoughts on behalf of the\npeople of Judah. He situates this event within the context of God’s\nrule over all kingdoms on earth. God will judge the Assyrians, even\nthough he had used them as his own instrument, because they were\nexcessively destructive and proud.\nNahum’s oracle describes God’s character and power, announcing God’s\npurpose to judge Assyria.

God responds that he has a\nplan to judge all evil thoroughly and finally. But God also says that\nHabakkuk must learn to endure his current sufferings and trust his\nGod.\nUltimately, God’s answer to the problem of evil begins to be answered\nin the death of Jesus. In Jesus God endured suffering, trusted his\nGod, and was ultimately raised from the dead. Habakkuk shows us that\nbecause of Jesus we know that God will judge evil and rescue his\npeople.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2012 Habakkuk Series (Mid Week)\n2020 Habakkuk Series (Sundays)\nHabakkuk Misc Selection\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Habakkuk Introduction\n\nNear the time of the transition from the Assyrian to the Babylonian\nempires (late 7th century BC), the prophet Habakkuk engaged in a\nprofound dialogue with Israel’s God. The form of his book is a short\nseries of complaints, or laments, followed by the divine\nresponses. When Habakkuk’s cries are answered, he closes with a hymn\nof confidence in God’s expected victory.\nThe prophet begins by asking how long God will allow evil to\ntriumph. The divine reply is that God is raising up the Babylonians as\nhis tool of correction. This leads to Habakkuk’s second question: Why\ndo you allow the wicked to swallow up those more righteous than\nthemselves? God replies again, explaining that the Babylonians will be\njudged just like the Assyrians, and that the righteous must await this\nin faith and patience. The inevitability of Babylon’s doom is\nemphasized when God pronounces a series of five woes against it.\nWhen Habakkuk’s dialogue with God concludes, the book moves to what is\ncalled A prayer of Habakkuk. But its musical notations reveal that it\nis clearly meant to be sung. Habakkuk celebrates God’s dramatic\nintervention for Israel in the past and prays that God will do it\nagain. The prophet resolves in the meantime to wait patiently for\nGod’s coming.\n\nBible Project\n\nHabakkuk Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Habakkuk_BP', 'Habakkuk_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2012 Habakkuk Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingHabakkuk 1-310/24/2012 1.TeachingHabakkuk 1-310/24/2012\n\n\n2020 Habakkuk Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.When God Doesn’t Make SenseHabakkuk02/02/2020Study Guide 1.When God Doesn’t Make SenseHabakkuk02/02/2020Study Guide\n\n\nHabakkuk Misc Selection\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.God, Help us!

Zephaniah warns\nIsrael and the surrounding nations that the Day of the Lord is\nnear. God will judge the nations with a burning fire as he purifies\nthem from sin, evil, and violence.\nBut the coming Day of the Lord is not without hope. It will remove\nevil from among God’s people and open up a new future where all\nhumanity can flourish in peace.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2012 Zephaniah Series (Mid Week)\n2020 Zephaniah Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Zephaniah Introduction\n\nThe reign of King Manasseh of Judah was the time of greatest\ncorruption, injustice and paganism in Judah’s history. But Manasseh’s\ngrandson King Josiah reasserted the nation’s faith and obedience to\nGod and its independence from foreign empires. One reason for this\nseems to be that a member of his court stood up and warned that\nJudah’s breaking of the covenant had led it to the brink of\ndestruction. The person who offered this warning was the prophet\nZephaniah.\nThe book’s prologue identifies Zephaniah as the great-great-grandson\nof Hezekiah. No other prophet’s ancestry is traced back four\ngenerations, so this seems intended to associate Zephaniah with the\ngreat reforming king of Judah. It is likely that Zephaniah was of\nroyal blood, since he was familiar with particular districts in\nJerusalem and with specific activities in the capital.\nThis collection of prophecies has three main parts. First is a\ndescription of the day of the Lord that is coming against Judah and\nJerusalem. Next is a call for national repentance, along with oracles\nof destruction against the Philistines, Moabites, Cushites\n(Ethiopians), Assyrians and Jerusalem itself. In the final section,\nZephaniah promises that God will restore a humble remnant when he\nreturns as a Mighty Warrior among his people.\n\nBible Project\n\nZephaniah Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Zephaniah_BP', 'Zephaniah_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2012 Zephaniah Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingZephaniah 1-311/07/2012 1.TeachingZephaniah 1-311/07/2012\n\n\n2020 Zephaniah Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.When God SingsZephaniah02/09/2020Study Guide 1.When God SingsZephaniah02/09/2020Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Haggai.html":{"url":"Haggai.html","title":"Haggai","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

The book of\nHaggai was written 70 years after this prophesied exile and recounts\nthe experience of a small group of Israelites, led by Joshua and\nZerubbabel, who returned to rebuild Jerusalem.\nThe recently returned exiles face hardship in their rebuilding efforts\nand struggle to remain faithful after so much loss and\ndisappointment.

One group returned the next year, completing and dedicating\nthe temple foundation within two more years. But they were stopped by\nsuspicious and resentful neighbors who had influence in the Persian\ncourt (see Ezra 4:4–6:22). Sixteen years later, when King Darius takes\nthe throne, the prophet Haggai urges the people to restart their\nwork. He calls specifically on Zerubbabel, the appointed governor, and\nJoshua the high priest, to lead the project. Within four years the\nreconstruction was completed and worship in the temple resumed.\nHaggai delivers his four messages during a strategic four-month period\nat the beginning of Darius’ reign. The first message explains that\nIsrael’s crops aren’t being blessed because God’s house has been left\nin ruins. The second message gives encouragement to those who found\nthe new temple disappointing compared to Solomon’s original\ntemple. God promises that its glory will outshine the first\ntemple. The third message assures the people that from now on their\ncrops will be blessed. The final message is a personal encouragement\nto Zerubbabel himself, the heir to the throne of David.

The book of Zechariah answers this question\nthrough several dream visions, challenging God's peopel to remain\nfaithful and hope in God’s promises.\nThese bizarre images remind God's people that they must remain\nfaithful to the covenant if they want the new Jerusalem, messianic\nKingdom, and the end of evil to come to pass. Even though the book\ndoesn't follow a neat, orderly pattern and contains scary and bizarre\nimages, it shows glimpses of God's hand in guiding history toward his\npurposes.

The book has two main parts. The first contains two sequences of\nprophecies, primarily in the form of symbolic vision reports. The\nsecond main part is made up mostly of poetic oracles concerned with\nthe nation’s leaders.\nAfter a general call to repentance, Zechariah records a series of\neight visions to encourage the people in rebuilding the temple. The\nfirst and last describe four differently colored horses and their\nriders sent over the earth. The second and third visions show that\nhostile foreign powers no longer threaten the country. The sixth and\nseventh visions report the removal of the people’s sins. The two\ncentral visions depict God establishing Joshua the high priest and\nZerubbabel the governor. The overall message is that God has\neverything in place for the rebuilding project.\nThe second sequence of prophecies has six parts. Ever since the\ndisaster of the exile and the temple’s destruction, the people had\nbeen fasting at certain times of the year. The messages here urge the\npeople to practice justice as the true form of fasting and to focus on\nrebuilding. Then Zechariah announces that all their fasts will become\njoyful celebrations.\nThe book’s final section predicts that after the people suffer under\nbad shepherds, God will send a righteous king from David’s line.

They’ve\nfailed again and again. And while God will deal with their sin, he\nwill not abandon them. He promises to redeem a remnant and send a\nMessiah to fulfill his covenant promises.\nOne hundred years after exile, the Israelites who had returned to\nJerusalem were as evil and corrupt as their ancestors. The book of\nMalachi addresses their sins—they’ve corrupted the sacrificial system,\nhoarded their money, and worshiped foreign gods.

The\nnew temple was meant to be the centerpiece of a community in which\nthere was true justice and genuine worship. In this way Israel could\nfulfill its calling and be a light, revealing God to the nations.\nUnfortunately, as the years went by, the people fell further and\nfurther away from this ideal. By the middle of the next century, their\nworship had become corrupt, and their society was plagued with\ninjustice. Malachi (“my messenger”) challenges the people to honor God\nproperly in their worship and in their dealings with one another. The\nworld could then come to know the Lord as the great king.\nMalachi brings his challenges in a distinctive style. He first offers\nan abrupt charge, voices the anticipated objections, and finally\nanswers those objections. The book records that some of the people\nrepent in response to these challenges, and that God says he will\nspare them when he comes to judge the earth. The book ends with God’s\npromise to send the prophet Elijah back before that great and dreadful\nday of the Lord.\n\nBible Project\n\nMalachi Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Malachi_BP', 'Malachi_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\nAs of 12/2023 Spoken Gospel has no malachi introduction\n\n2013 Malachi Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingMalachi 1-201/23/2013 2.TeachingMalachi 3-401/30/2013 1.TeachingMalachi 1-201/23/2013 2.TeachingMalachi 3-401/30/2013\n\n\n2020 Malachi Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Ministry, Marriage, and MoneyMalachi03/01/2020Study Guide 1.Ministry, Marriage, and MoneyMalachi03/01/2020Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"NewTestament.html":{"url":"NewTestament.html","title":"New Testament","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

He pictures the\nOld Testament like a treasure chest that contain old and new treasure\n(Matthew 13:52). The old treasure in the Hebrew scriptures hasn't gone\nanywhere, neither has it faded or lost value (Matthew 5:17-18). But\nMatthew helps us see that there is a new treasure hidden in Scripture,\nand it is Jesus. All of the Old Testament finds its new treasure in\nhow Jesus fulfills it.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2013 Matthew Series (Mid Week)\n2020-2021 Matthew Series (Sundays)\nMatthew Misc Selection\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Matthew Introduction\n\nMatthew’s purpose is to show that God has kept his ancient promises to\nIsrael through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus the\nMessiah. The long-expected reign of heaven is now coming to earth,\nbringing the Jewish story to its climax. Matthew begins by\nhighlighting that Jesus was the son of David, Israel’s most famous\nking, and the son of Abraham, Israel’s founding patriarch. Jesus is\nthe true Israelite and God’s promised Messiah.\nThe Messiah is shown as reliving the story of Israel—going down into\nthe Jordan River, facing temptation in the wilderness, gathering\ntwelve disciples as twelve new tribes, ascending a mountain to deliver\na new Torah, etc. The author highlights the idea of Jesus as a new\nMoses by collecting his teachings into five long speeches. These are\nmarked off by some variation of the phrase When Jesus had finished\nsaying these things. Just as the Torah had five books, Matthew presents\nfive major sections.\nThe book concludes by telling how Jesus brought about the great new\nact of redemption for his people. As in the story of Israel’s Exodus,\na Passover meal is celebrated and then deliverance comes. Jesus gives\nhis life for the sake of the world and is then raised from the\ndead. At the beginning of the book, Jesus is given the name Immanuel,\nmeaning “God with us.” At the end, Jesus sends his followers into the\nworld with the promise that surely I am with you always.\n\nBible Project\n\nMatthew Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Matthew_BP', 'Matthew_BP.png', 75)

Mark answers this question by showing how everything Jesus\ndid in his life prepares us for and informs us about his death.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2013-2014 Mark Series (Mid Week)\n2021 Mark Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Mark Introduction\n\nMark appears to be written for an audience in Rome. A Roman\ncenturion’s declaration near the end of the book - Surely this man was\nthe Son of God! - models the witness to Jesus this gospel calls for.\nThe opening half of this fast-moving drama keys on the question: Who\ndo you say I am? An episode at the end of the first half shows Jesus\nhealing a blind man in two stages, so that he slowly comes to see. In\nthe same way the disciples have only gradually come to recognize who\nJesus is. Then in a key moment in the story, between its two halves,\nPeter confesses that Jesus is the Messiah.\nNow the conflict moves out into the open. Jesus has come to introduce\na radical new way of life that will undercut existing power\nrelationships. The second half of the drama depicts this in three\nacts:\n\nJesus and his disciples travel to Jerusalem.\n\nJesus teaches in the temple and clashes with the\nestablished leadership.\n\nIn the final act, that leadership executes its plan and has\nJesus arrested and crucified, seemingly overturning all he has\ndone. But then God overturns their deed and raises Jesus to\nlife. So Mark’s readers are called to be faithful to Jesus, even in\nsuffering, because this is how God continues to overturn the\nexisting order and establish the way of life that Jesus taught.\n\n\n\nBible Project\n\nMark Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Mark_BP', 'Mark_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2013-2014 Mark Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingMark 111/13/2013 2.TeachingMark 211/20/2013 3.TeachingMark 312/04/2013 4.TeachingMark 4-5:2012/11/2013 5.TeachingMark 5:21-6:1312/18/2013 6.TeachingMark 6:13-7:2301/08/2014 7.TeachingMark 7:23-8:3801/15/2014 8.TeachingMark 902/05/2014 9.TeachingMark 9:33-5002/12/2014 10.TeachingMark 1002/19/2014 11.TeachingMark 11-12:1703/05/2014 12.TeachingMark 12:18-13:3703/12/2014 13.TeachingMark 14:1-2603/19/2014 14.TeachingMark 14:12-5203/26/2014 15.TeachingMark 14:53-15:1504/02/2014 16.TeachingMark 15:16-16:2004/09/2014 1.TeachingMark 111/13/2013 2.TeachingMark 211/20/2013 3.TeachingMark 312/04/2013 4.TeachingMark 4-5:2012/11/2013 5.TeachingMark 5:21-6:1312/18/2013 6.TeachingMark 6:13-7:2301/08/2014 7.TeachingMark 7:23-8:3801/15/2014 8.TeachingMark 902/05/2014 9.TeachingMark 9:33-5002/12/2014 10.TeachingMark 1002/19/2014 11.TeachingMark 11-12:1703/05/2014 12.TeachingMark 12:18-13:3703/12/2014 13.TeachingMark 14:1-2603/19/2014 14.TeachingMark 14:12-5203/26/2014 15.TeachingMark 14:53-15:1504/02/2014 16.TeachingMark 15:16-16:2004/09/2014\n\n\n2021 Mark Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Pray Like JesusMark 104/18/2021Study Guide 2.Patches and WineskinsMark 2:18-2204/25/2021Study Guide 3.What Hinders Fruitfulness?Mark 405/02/2021Study Guide 4.Losing Your Head over a GrudgeMark 605/16/2021Study Guide 5.Mountains or Valleys, Jesus is ThereMark 905/23/2021Study Guide 6.Opposition to Jesus and His ChurchMark 1205/30/2021Study Guide 7.What's the Cost?Mark 12:41-4406/13/2021Study Guide 8.When God Tore a CurtainMark 1506/20/2021Study Guide 1.Pray Like JesusMark 104/18/2021Study Guide 2.Patches and WineskinsMark 2:18-2204/25/2021Study Guide 3.What Hinders Fruitfulness?Mark 405/02/2021Study Guide 4.Losing Your Head over a GrudgeMark 605/16/2021Study Guide 5.Mountains or Valleys, Jesus is ThereMark 905/23/2021Study Guide 6.Opposition to Jesus and His ChurchMark 1205/30/2021Study Guide 7.What's the Cost?Mark 12:41-4406/13/2021Study Guide 8.When God Tore a CurtainMark 1506/20/2021Study Guide\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Luke.html":{"url":"Luke.html","title":"Luke","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

It emphasizes the upside-down nature of God’s\nKingdom - a place where all are welcome and power structures are\nreversed.\nLuke's Gospel emphasizes Jesus' care for the marginalized. Jesus'\ncompassion for the poor, captive, oppressed, and blind fulfills\nscriptures about the final deliverance God will bring to all who are\nin need. But people couldn't see it. That is because they, like all of\nus, were spiritually blind. But when Jesus heals our spiritual\nblindness, we can see him and the scriptures as they truly are.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2014-2015 Luke Series (Mid Week)\n2021-2022 Luke Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Luke Introduction\n\nThe books of Luke and Acts are two volumes of a single work. Together\nthey tell the story of how God first invited the people of Israel, and\nthen all nations, to follow Jesus. In the first volume, the movement\nis toward Jerusalem, the center of Jewish national life. In the\nsecond, the movement is from Jerusalem to other nations, closing with\nPaul proclaiming the kingdom of God in Rome, the capital of the\nempire.\nLuke addresses his history to most excellent Theophilus,most likely a\nRoman official. His volumes are stocked with details from sources Luke\nhad available: letters, speeches, songs, travel accounts, trial\ntranscripts and biographical anecdotes. Luke’s purpose is to show the\nfulfillment of God’s plan to bring his light to the world through\nIsrael. The earliest Jesus-followers take up this calling by\nannouncing Jesus’ victory over sin and death to all the nations.\nThe first volume, Luke’s telling of the story of Jesus, has three main\nsections:\n\nJesus ministers in Galilee, the northern area of the land of\nIsrael.\n\nHe takes a long journey to Jerusalem, during which he welcomes\npeople into the way of God’s reign and challenges Israel’s current\nunderstanding of the kingdom.\n\nLuke tells how Jesus gives his life in Jerusalem and then rises\nfrom the dead to be revealed as Israel’s King and the world’s true\nLord.\n\n\n\nBible Project\n\nLuke Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Luke_BP', 'Luke_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\nPart 1: Luke 1-9 ...\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Luke 10-24\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2014-2015 Luke Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingLuke 104/23/2014 2.TeachingLuke 1:26-8004/30/2014 3.TeachingLuke 205/07/2014 4.TeachingLuke 305/14/2014 5.TeachingLuke 4:1-3005/21/2014 6.TeachingLuke 4:31-5:1105/28/2014 7.TeachingLuke 506/18/2014 8.TeachingLuke 607/02/2014 9.TeachingLuke 708/13/2014 10.TeachingLuke 8:1-2508/20/2014 11.TeachingLuke 8:26-5608/27/2014 12.TeachingLuke 9:1-3609/03/2014 13.TeachingLuke 9:37-6209/10/2014 14.TeachingLuke 10:1-2409/17/2014 15.TeachingLuke 10:25-4210/01/2014 16.TeachingLuke 1110/08/2014 17.TeachingLuke 11:33-5210/15/2014 18.TeachingLuke 12:1-3410/22/2014 19.TeachingLuke 12:35-5910/29/2014 20.TeachingLuke 1311/12/2014 21.TeachingLuke 1411/19/2014 22.TeachingLuke 1512/03/2014 23.TeachingLuke 1612/10/2014 24.TeachingLuke 1712/17/2014 25.TeachingLuke 18:1-3001/07/2015 26.TeachingLuke 1901/14/2015 27.TeachingLuke 20:1-2601/21/2015 28.TeachingLuke 20-2101/28/2015 29.TeachingLuke 22:1-3802/04/2015 30.TeachingLuke 22:38-6202/11/2015 31.TeachingLuke 23-2402/18/2015 1.TeachingLuke 104/23/2014 2.TeachingLuke 1:26-8004/30/2014 3.TeachingLuke 205/07/2014 4.TeachingLuke 305/14/2014 5.TeachingLuke 4:1-3005/21/2014 6.TeachingLuke 4:31-5:1105/28/2014 7.TeachingLuke 506/18/2014 8.TeachingLuke 607/02/2014 9.TeachingLuke 708/13/2014 10.TeachingLuke 8:1-2508/20/2014 11.TeachingLuke 8:26-5608/27/2014 12.TeachingLuke 9:1-3609/03/2014 13.TeachingLuke 9:37-6209/10/2014 14.TeachingLuke 10:1-2409/17/2014 15.TeachingLuke 10:25-4210/01/2014 16.TeachingLuke 1110/08/2014 17.TeachingLuke 11:33-5210/15/2014 18.TeachingLuke 12:1-3410/22/2014 19.TeachingLuke 12:35-5910/29/2014 20.TeachingLuke 1311/12/2014 21.TeachingLuke 1411/19/2014 22.TeachingLuke 1512/03/2014 23.TeachingLuke 1612/10/2014 24.TeachingLuke 1712/17/2014 25.TeachingLuke 18:1-3001/07/2015 26.TeachingLuke 1901/14/2015 27.TeachingLuke 20:1-2601/21/2015 28.TeachingLuke 20-2101/28/2015 29.TeachingLuke 22:1-3802/04/2015 30.TeachingLuke 22:38-6202/11/2015 31.TeachingLuke 23-2402/18/2015\n\n\n2021-2022 Luke Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.God Remembers His OathLuke 108/01/2021Study Guide 2.Lessons from NazarethLuke 408/08/2021Study Guide 3.Healing Soul and BodyLuke 508/15/2021Study Guide 4.Dead Man TalkingLuke 708/22/2021Study Guide 5.Relatable Like JesusLuke 708/29/2021Study Guide 6.Paradox Principles for LifeLuke 909/05/2021Study Guide 7.The Good SamaritanLuke 1009/12/2021Study Guide 8.Lessons From LukeLuke 6:27-4609/19/2021Study Guide 9.An Enemy Named BusyLuke 10:38-4210/10/2021Study Guide 10.Don’t Worry About ItLuke 1210/24/2021Study Guide 11.The Theology of TragedyLuke 1311/07/2021Study Guide 12.Walk Through that DoorLuke 13:22-3011/14/2021Study Guide 13.Once was Lost, Now am FoundLuke 1512/12/2021Study Guide 14.Worldly Wealth for Heavenly GoodLuke 1601/09/2022Study Guide 15.Life After DeathLuke 16:19-3101/16/2022Study Guide 16.Where Are the Nine?Luke 17:11-1901/30/2022Study Guide 17.Practice Persistent PrayerLuke 1802/13/2022Study Guide 18.I Need a MiracleLuke 18:35-4302/20/2022Study Guide 19.Small Man, Big ChangeLuke 19:1-1002/27/2022Study Guide 20.Why Jesus WeepsLuke 19:41-4403/06/2022Study Guide 21.A Glimpse of Life in HeavenLuke 2003/13/2022Study Guide 22.The Rise of Russia and the End TimesLuke 21Ezekiel 3803/20/2022 23.Jesus: Our Passover LambLUKE 22:1-2003/27/2022Study Guide 24.Kissers and WeepersLUKE 22:20-6204/03/2022Study Guide 25.We are BarabbasLUKE 2304/10/2022Study Guide 26.Evidence for the Head, Hope for the Heart (Easter)LUKE 2404/17/2022 27.Discouraged While Walking With Jesus?

Just as the first creation was completed in seven days,\nJohn uses the number seven to structure his book. For the Jews the\nnumber seven represented completeness and wholeness, a finished work\nof God revealing his purpose for the world.\nThe story is told in two main parts. The first describes Jesus’ public\nministry and has seven sections. Each section closes with a report on\nhow people respond to Jesus, either in faith or unbelief. The second\npart is devoted to the Passover weekend, when Jesus gave his life for\nthe world.\nJohn records seven instances in which Jesus revealed his identity by\nusing the phrase I am, the name by which God had revealed himself\nearlier. Similarly, John records seven miraculous signs that Jesus\nperformed. John’s narrative mentions twice that the resurrection of\nJesus took place on the first day of the week. In this way he confirms\nthat the power of a new creation has broken into our world.\n\nBible Project\n\nJohn Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('John_BP', 'John_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\nPart 1: John 1-12 ...\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nPart 2: John 13-21\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2015 John Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingJohn 1:1-3403/11/2015 2.TeachingJohn 1:35-2:1203/18/2015 3.TeachingJohn 2:13-3:2103/25/2015 4.TeachingJohn 3:22-4:2604/08/2015 5.TeachingJohn 4:27-5:1504/15/2015 6.TeachingJohn 5:16-6:2404/22/2015 7.TeachingJohn 6:25-7104/29/2015 8.TeachingJohn 7:1-3705/06/2015 9.TeachingJohn 7:37-8:1105/13/2015 10.TeachingJohn 8:12-5805/20/2015 11.TeachingJohn 9-10:2105/27/2015 12.TeachingJohn 10:21-4206/03/2015 13.TeachingJohn 1106/10/2015 14.TeachingJohn 1206/17/2015 15.TeachingJohn 1307/01/2015 16.TeachingJohn 14:15-2108/26/2015 17.TeachingJohn 14:22-15:809/02/2015 18.TeachingJohn 15:8-16:1509/09/2015 19.TeachingJohn 16:15-17:2609/16/2015 20.TeachingJohn 18-19:1509/30/2015 21.TeachingJohn 19:16-20:1810/07/2015 22.TeachingJohn 20:19-2110/14/2015 1.TeachingJohn 1:1-3403/11/2015 2.TeachingJohn 1:35-2:1203/18/2015 3.TeachingJohn 2:13-3:2103/25/2015 4.TeachingJohn 3:22-4:2604/08/2015 5.TeachingJohn 4:27-5:1504/15/2015 6.TeachingJohn 5:16-6:2404/22/2015 7.TeachingJohn 6:25-7104/29/2015 8.TeachingJohn 7:1-3705/06/2015 9.TeachingJohn 7:37-8:1105/13/2015 10.TeachingJohn 8:12-5805/20/2015 11.TeachingJohn 9-10:2105/27/2015 12.TeachingJohn 10:21-4206/03/2015 13.TeachingJohn 1106/10/2015 14.TeachingJohn 1206/17/2015 15.TeachingJohn 1307/01/2015 16.TeachingJohn 14:15-2108/26/2015 17.TeachingJohn 14:22-15:809/02/2015 18.TeachingJohn 15:8-16:1509/09/2015 19.TeachingJohn 16:15-17:2609/16/2015 20.TeachingJohn 18-19:1509/30/2015 21.TeachingJohn 19:16-20:1810/07/2015 22.TeachingJohn 20:19-2110/14/2015\n\n\n2022 John Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.The Identity and Deity of JesusJohn 105/08/2022Study Guide 2.God Has Saved the Best for LastJohn 205/15/2022Study Guide 3.Spiritual BirthJohn 305/22/2022Study Guide 4.Complete in JesusJohn 405/29/2022Study Guide 5.Miracle at the PoolJohn 506/05/2022Study Guide 6.When Bread Is Not EnoughJohn 606/12/2022Study Guide 7.Living Water -

But there is\nsomething deeply significant in the way it is laid out and\ndescribed. Acts shows the Gospel going to Jerusalem, Judea and\nSamaria, and then to the ends of the earth. This growth, from the\ncenter out, is what was supposed to happen back in the Garden of\nEden. Acts, then, shows us that God's purposes for humanity, that he\nbegan at creation, are finally being brought to completion through\nJesus, the Gospel, and his Church.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2009 Acts Series (Sundays)\n2015-2016 Acts Series (Mid Week)\n2023 Acts Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Acts Introduction\n\nLuke’s second volume is known as the book of Acts.

These sections\nare all marked by variations on the phrase the word of God continued\nto spread and flourish:\n\nThe church is established in Jerusalem and becomes Greek-speaking,\nallowing it to spread its message throughout the empire.\n\nThe movement expands into the rest of Palestine.\n\nGentiles are included in the gathering of Jesus-followers\nalongside Jews.\n\nMessengers are sent west into the Roman province of Asia.\n\nThese messengers enter Europe.\n\nThe movement reaches the capital city\nof Rome and into the highest levels of society; God’s kingdom is\nthus announced to all nations.\n\n\n\nBible Project\n\nActs Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Acts_BP', 'Acts_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\nPart 1: Acts 1-12 ...\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Acts 13-28\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nEye Witness\n\nAn eyewitness introduction to the people found in scriptures ...

God’s covenants with his human partners were\nimperfect, and humans failed to be faithful to the agreement. But\nJesus established a new covenant that is open to all people, Jew and\nGentile, creating a multiethnic family of God where self-giving love\nand forgiveness are at the center of everything.\nRomans is one of the most famous, quoted, and dearly loved books in\nthe whole Bible. This may be because it contains some of the clearest\nand strong statements of the Gospel we have in Scripture. But other\nparts of Romans, and how it all fits together, can be difficult to\nfollow. That is because there is a story behind the book of Romans. It\nis the story of the conflict which arose between Jews and Gentiles as\nthey began integrating in synagogues and house churches throughout\nRome, and how Jesus brings them together.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2009 Romans Series (Sundays)\n2016 Romans Series (Mid Week)\n2021 Romans Misc\n2024 Romans Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Romans Introduction\n\nAddressing the believers in Rome, Paul writes what is most likely the\nmeatiest missionary fundraising letter ever written. To\nJesus-followers living directly under the shadow of Caesar, he is\nappealing for help to bring the gospel to the western part of the\nempire. As an apostle, Paul has been set apart to make the royal\nannouncement about the Lordship of Jesus. God’s plan for the world has\nbeen revealed through a descendant of king David—Jesus the\nMessiah. This message demonstrates that God has been faithful to his\ncovenant with Israel.\nThe flow of the letter follows the pattern of the ancient Jewish story\nof slavery and rescue. Humanity is in exile due to the entrance of sin\nand death into the world. Even the Jewish law could not defeat death\nand bring life. But God has come to rescue both Jews and Gentiles\nthrough the death and resurrection of Jesus. A new worldwide family is\nbeing created. Baptism into Jesus breaks the power of evil and brings\nfreedom. The Holy Spirit leads the way into this new life that will be\ncomplete in a new inheritance—a redeemed creation.\nAlthough many in Israel had failed to believe in the Messiah, this\nended up bringing life to the rest of the world. The offer of life\nthrough Jesus remains for all, however, and in the end God’s mercy\nwill triumph over judgment. The closing emphasis is on the practical\nshape of a redeemed humanity’s new way of life.\n\nBible Project\n\nRomans Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Romans_BP', 'Romans_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\nPart 1: Romans 1-4\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Romans 5-16\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2009 Romans Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\nNote: As of 2024, this series has been archived\n(i.e. is no longer available ), however the Study Guides are still\navailable.\n\n 1.Good News and Bad NewsRom 1-208/09/2009 2.What a Gift!Rom 3-508/16/2009 3.The Sin BattleRom 6-808/30/2009 4.Why Israel MattersRom 9-1109/06/2009Study Guide 5.Offering Your BodyRom 12-1309/13/2009Study Guide 6.Unity in the ChurchRom 14-1609/20/2009Study Guide 1.Good News and Bad NewsRom 1-208/09/2009 2.What a Gift!Rom 3-508/16/2009 3.The Sin BattleRom 6-808/30/2009 4.Why Israel MattersRom 9-1109/06/2009Study Guide 5.Offering Your BodyRom 12-1309/13/2009Study Guide 6.Unity in the ChurchRom 14-1609/20/2009Study Guide\n\n\n2016 Romans Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingRom 1:1-2505/18/2016 2.TeachingRom 1:25-3205/25/2016 3.TeachingRom 206/01/2016 4.TeachingRom 306/08/2016 5.TeachingRom 4-5:1106/15/2016 6.TeachingRom 5:12-6:1407/27/2016 7.TeachingRom 6:15-7:2508/03/2016 8.TeachingRom 8:1-2708/10/2016 9.TeachingRom 8:28-9:1608/17/2016 10.TeachingRom 9:16-10:2108/24/2016 11.TeachingRom 11:1-2708/31/2016 12.TeachingRom 11:25-12:209/07/2016 13.TeachingRom 12:3-2109/21/2016 14.TeachingRom 1309/28/2016 15.TeachingRom 1410/05/2016 16.TeachingRom 15-1610/12/2016 1.TeachingRom 1:1-2505/18/2016 2.TeachingRom 1:25-3205/25/2016 3.TeachingRom 206/01/2016 4.TeachingRom 306/08/2016 5.TeachingRom 4-5:1106/15/2016 6.TeachingRom 5:12-6:1407/27/2016 7.TeachingRom 6:15-7:2508/03/2016 8.TeachingRom 8:1-2708/10/2016 9.TeachingRom 8:28-9:1608/17/2016 10.TeachingRom 9:16-10:2108/24/2016 11.TeachingRom 11:1-2708/31/2016 12.TeachingRom 11:25-12:209/07/2016 13.TeachingRom 12:3-2109/21/2016 14.TeachingRom 1309/28/2016 15.TeachingRom 1410/05/2016 16.TeachingRom 15-1610/12/2016\n\n\n2021 Romans Misc\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.The True Nature of God (Barrett Phillips)Rom 1:16-2509/22/2021 2.The Mystery of the Blindness (Amir Tsarfati)Rom 11:2509/26/2021 3.Conformed or Transformed?

Specifically, Paul addresses divisions\namong believers, food, sexual integrity, worship gatherings, and the\nresurrection.\nIn 1 Corinthians, Paul applies the Gospel to the sin, conflicts, and\nproblems within the church at Corinth.  Many of these problems stemmed\nfrom the Greek's views about wisdom, which informed many of their\nmoral and religious decisions. The Gospel of Jesus counteracts the\nworld's wisdom because Jesus' death did not look like wisdom to most\npeople. However, in this letter, Paul proves that Jesus going to the\ncross is the wisest thing that has ever happened.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2009 1 Corinthians Series (Sundays)\n2016-2017 1 Corinthians Series (Mid Week)\n2024 1 Corinthians Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible 1 Corinthians Introduction\n\nThe book of Acts describes how Paul brought the royal news about Jesus\nthe Messiah to Macedonia (northern Greece), but then had to flee to\nAchaia (southern Greece) for his own safety. He visited the city of\nCorinth there, a wealthy and cosmopolitan commercial center. Many\npeople became believers, so he stayed for a year and a half to teach\nthem.\nAfter he left, the Corinthians wrote to Paul (in a letter we no longer\nhave) with some key questions. The Corinthians had adopted the common\nGreek idea that physical things are bad, so they wanted to free the\nhuman spirit from the body. This affected the way they saw such things\nas marriage, attendance at ceremonial meals for pagan gods, and even\nthe resurrection of Jesus. In the letter we know as 1 Corinthians Paul\naddresses all of these concerns, as well as questions about worship.\nPaul writes that this world in its present form is passing away,but\nthe Corinthians can give themselves fully to the work of the Lord\nsince their labor in the Lord is not in vain. The coming resurrection\nof the dead, and the new world that will accompany it, will show the\nvalue of all their current efforts. Paul’s practical advice for how to\nconsistently embody the new life of God’s kingdom during a particular\nscene in the biblical drama gives us great insight as we seek to take\nup our roles today.\n\nBible Project\n\n1 Corinthians Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('1Corinthians_BP', '1Corinthians_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2009 1 Corinthians Series (Sundays)\nNote: As of 2024, this series has been archived\n(i.e. is no longer available ), however the Study Guides are still\navailable.\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.When Wisdom Seems Foolish1 Cor 1-309/27/2009Study Guide 2.Church Discipline1 Cor 4-510/04/2009Study Guide 3.Lessons on Lawsuits1 Cor 610/18/2009Study Guide 4.Singleness, Marriage, Sex, and Divorce1 Cor 710/25/2009Study Guide 5.When Temptation Comes1 Cor 8-1011/01/2009Study Guide 6.Communion1 Cor 1111/08/2009Study Guide 7.Defining Spiritual Gifts1 Cor 1211/15/2009Study Guide 8.Guidelines for Spiritual Gifts1 Cor 13-1411/22/2009Study Guide 9.Extreme Makeover: A Glorified Body1 Cor 15-1611/29/2009Study Guide 1.When Wisdom Seems Foolish1 Cor 1-309/27/2009Study Guide 2.Church Discipline1 Cor 4-510/04/2009Study Guide 3.Lessons on Lawsuits1 Cor 610/18/2009Study Guide 4.Singleness, Marriage, Sex, and Divorce1 Cor 710/25/2009Study Guide 5.When Temptation Comes1 Cor 8-1011/01/2009Study Guide 6.Communion1 Cor 1111/08/2009Study Guide 7.Defining Spiritual Gifts1 Cor 1211/15/2009Study Guide 8.Guidelines for Spiritual Gifts1 Cor 13-1411/22/2009Study Guide 9.Extreme Makeover: A Glorified Body1 Cor 15-1611/29/2009Study Guide\n\n\n2016-2017 1 Corinthians Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Teaching1 Cor 110/19/2016 2.Teaching1 Cor 2-310/26/2016 3.Teaching1 Cor 4-511/02/2016 4.Teaching1 Cor 611/09/2016 5.Teaching1 Cor 7:1-1611/30/2016 6.Teaching1 Cor 7:17-4012/07/2016 7.Teaching1 Cor 8-912/14/2016 8.Teaching1 Cor 1001/04/2017 9.Teaching1 Cor 1101/11/2017 10.Communion1 Cor 11:17-3401/18/2017 11.Teaching1 Cor 12:1-1101/25/2017 12.Gifts of the Spirit -

Through the cross and\nresurrection, Jesus’ followers can live differently and model\ngenerosity, humility, and weakness. 2 Cornithians is a letter about\nliving in a totally counter-cultural way as we seek to live like Jesus\ndid.\n2 Corinthians shows how God's strength is made perfect in\nweakness. This is seen most clearly in Paul's dealings with the\nso-called \"Super Apostles\" that had taken over leadership of the\nchurch he planted in Corinth. The Super Apostles boasted in their\nabilities, connections, and power. But Paul showed that, for those in\nChrist, true power comes in weakness.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2009-2010 2 Corinthians Series (Sundays)\n2017 2 Corinthians Series (Mid Week)\n2025 2 Corinthians Series (Sundays)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible 2 Corinthians Introduction\n\nPaul’s first letter to the believers in Corinth gives us a glimpse\ninto his deeply personal and tumultuous relationship with this\ngathering of Jesus-followers. The letter we know as 2 Corinthians\nfurther reveals the triumphs and struggles that result when life in\nthe present age meets up with the in-breaking reality of God’s\nkingdom. Here we see Paul working to repair relationships, explain\nvarious changes in travel plans, make practical arrangements for\ncollecting a gift for the struggling believers in Jerusalem, and\ndirectly confront challenges to his own leadership by the\nself-proclaimed “super-apostles.”\nIn the four main parts of the letter, each introduced by a reference\nto a place, Paul envisions himself in different locations, recalling\nor anticipating his relationship with the Corinthians. The single\ntheme running through these sections is that God will comfort us in\nall our troubles, and we will offer this comfort to each other. This\nmodels the life of Jesus himself, who suffered first and then was\ncomforted. Like the crucified Messiah, we are weak, yet we live in\nGod’s power.\nIn the final section, however, Paul feels he has no choice but to make\nthe Corinthians uncomfortable, to help them face their present\ncondition.

Many leaders were requiring non-Jewish Christians to live\nby Jewish laws, missing the point of the Gospel message. Jesus\nfulfilled the law and reconciled all who believe in him. When people\ntrust in Jesus as the Messiah, his life, death, and resurrection\nbecome theirs. They are new creations, free from the laws and the old\ncovenant.\nGalatians addresses the sensitive and complex issue of the role Old\nTestament Law plays in salvation, specifically regarding\ncircumcision. Paul's main goal in his letter to the Galatians is to\ndefend salvation by faith in Jesus, not by works of the Law. But in\norder to follow his argument and understand the good news he is\nsharing, we must grasp the true purpose of circumcision.\nThis sign was given to point to Abraham's future descendent who would\nbe a blessing to all nations. That sign was fulfilled in\nJesus. Therefore, faith in Jesus is the fulfillment of the command to\nbe circumcised. As you meditate on this truth, along with its wider\nimplications, we pray that the free and finished gift of the Gospel\nbecomes more and more beautiful to you.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2010 Galatians Series (Sundays)\n2017 Galatians Series (Mid Week)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Galatians Introduction\n\nGalatia was a Roman province in central Asia Minor. Paul traveled here\non each of the three journeys he made to spread the message about\nJesus. The Galatians received both Paul and his gospel announcement\nwarmly. But later some people Paul calls agitators came and challenged\nPaul’s leadership as well as the foundation of his teaching. So Paul\nwrote to answer the threat to his status as an apostle and to reaffirm\nthe core message that faith in the Messiah is the basis of membership\nin God’s new community.\nPaul doesn’t open his letter by appealing to the apostles in\nJerusalem. Instead, he insists that the gospel I preached is not of\nhuman origin … rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus\nChrist.  Paul is compelled to share this revelation, and he notes that\nthe other apostles support him.\nPaul then proceeds to his main argument, which is that Gentiles who\nhave become followers of Jesus do not need to be circumcised. The new\nworldwide family which had been promised to Abraham is created by\nfaith in Messiah Jesus, not by keeping the Jewish law (Torah). The\nbiblical story had been pointing to this all along.\nBut if following Torah is not the basis of the gospel, won’t there be\nanarchy? Paul answers by describing what Spirit-empowered life looks\nlike in the community of Messiah-followers. Paul closes by emphasizing\nthe main theme of his letter once more: Neither circumcision nor\nuncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation.\n\nBible Project\n\nGalatians Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Galatians_BP', 'Galatians_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2010 Galatians Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Jesus OnlyGal 1-301/31/2010Study Guide 2.The Battle WithinGal 4-602/14/2010Study Guide 1.Jesus OnlyGal 1-301/31/2010Study Guide 2.The Battle WithinGal 4-602/14/2010Study Guide\n\n\n2017 Galatians Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingGal 106/21/2017 2.TeachingGal 206/28/2017 3.TeachingGal 307/05/2017 4.TeachingGal 4-5:1307/12/2017 5.TeachingGal 5:13-6:1807/19/2017 1.TeachingGal 106/21/2017 2.TeachingGal 206/28/2017 3.TeachingGal 307/05/2017 4.TeachingGal 4-5:1307/12/2017 5.TeachingGal 5:13-6:1807/19/2017\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Ephesians.html":{"url":"Ephesians.html","title":"Ephesians","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

In fact, it’s written to a\nworld divided. We are divided from God and each other because we are\nruled by the author of division, Satan. But Ephesians says that in\nJesus, there is no more division, there are no more walls. Jews and\nGentiles, male and female, rich and poor, can all be one through faith\nin Jesus. That’s because Jesus defeated Satan, made us one with God,\nand is working within us to bring unity where there was division.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2010 Ephesians Series (Sundays)\n2017 Ephesians Series (Mid Week)\nEphesians Misc Selection\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Ephesians Introduction\n\nTraditionally named Ephesians, this letter may not actually have been\nwritten to the believers in Ephesus. Some of the best early copies of\nthe letter don’t include the phrase in Ephesus in the greeting. While\nPaul spent two years in Ephesus, this letter appears to address people\nPaul has never met.\nPaul here presents a two-fold pattern, first explaining the new\nidentity believers have in Christ and then bringing out the\nimplications for their new way of life. God has brought everything\ntogether under the rule of the Messiah, exalting Jesus above all\nthings. Paul echoes a phrase from Psalm 8 — God placed all things under\nhis feet — to show that Jesus is the truly human one. Jesus fulfills the\noriginal human calling to rule over the creation properly. Jews and\nGentiles have been brought together into one body, with Jesus at the\nhead. God is now creating one new humanity from all over the world\nthrough the reconciling work of the Messiah.\nThis means Jesus-followers must give up their former way of life and\npractice purity in daily living and integrity in their\nrelationships. The reciprocal responsibilities of those in and under\nauthority are used as key examples of the new kinds of relationships\nGod is expecting. Paul cautions his readers that they are entering a\nspiritual battle. They must arm themselves with all the resources God\nhas provided, until the Messiah brings unity to all things in heaven\nand on earth.\n\nBible Project\n\nEphesians Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Ephesians_BP', 'Ephesians_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2010 Ephesians Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Our Spiritual Blessings in ChristEphesians 1-202/21/2010Study Guide 2.Body BuildingEphesians 3-403/07/2010Study Guide 3.Biblical SubmissionEphesians 5-603/14/2010Study Guide 1.Our Spiritual Blessings in ChristEphesians 1-202/21/2010Study Guide 2.Body BuildingEphesians 3-403/07/2010Study Guide 3.Biblical SubmissionEphesians 5-603/14/2010Study Guide\n\n\n2017 Ephesians Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingEphesians 1:1-1407/26/2017 2.TeachingEphesians 1:15-2:1008/02/2017 3.TeachingEphesians 2:11-3:2109/06/2017 4.TeachingEphesians 4:1-1309/13/2017 5.TeachingEphesians 4:17-3209/20/2017 6.TeachingEphesians 509/27/2017 7.TeachingEphesians 6:1-2410/04/2017 1.TeachingEphesians 1:1-1407/26/2017 2.TeachingEphesians 1:15-2:1008/02/2017 3.TeachingEphesians 2:11-3:2109/06/2017 4.TeachingEphesians 4:1-1309/13/2017 5.TeachingEphesians 4:17-3209/20/2017 6.TeachingEphesians 509/27/2017 7.TeachingEphesians 6:1-2410/04/2017\n\n\nEphesians Misc Selection\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Who Are You Imitating?

It speaks of\nhow Jesus, though exalted, was humbled to the cross. But because he\nwas, God exalted him above every name. Philippians, along with its\nancient hymn, encourages the church in Philippi to follow Jesus’\nexample. They must humble themselves toward each other and in the face\nof persecution because they know they will be exalted with Christ.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2010 Philippians Series (Sundays)\n2017 Philippians Series (Mid Week)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Philippians Introduction\n\nOn his second journey to bring the gospel to the Gentile world, the\napostle Paul helped start a church in the city of Philippi (see Acts\n16:11-40), a colony of retired Roman soldiers. The Philippians became\nPaul’s friends and supporters for the rest of his life. When they\nheard that he was in Rome as a prisoner, they collected money to\nassist him and sent it with one of their members, a man named\nEpaphroditus. Later Paul sent him back with a letter to thank the\nPhilippians for their friendship and support.\nPaul knows the Philippians were experiencing a lot of opposition, so\nhe appeals to his own life as an example of how to respond to hardship\nwith joy. Throughout the whole palace guard — that is, right in the\ncenter of Caesar’s realm—Paul is boldly making the royal announcement\nthat Jesus is Lord. Paul’s desire is that the Philippians will gain\nthe same confidence and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel\nwithout fear.\nIn an amazing hymn, Paul urges the Philippians to have the servant\nattitude that Jesus had. He did not grasp his high position but\nhumbled himself even to the point of death—all for the sake of\nothers. This is the new way to be human that is revealed in God’s\nkingdom. Our citizenship is in God’s realm and so we eagerly await the\nSavior’s return to us. Then he will transform our lowly bodies to\nbecome like his glorious resurrected body.\n\nBible Project\n\nPhilippians Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Philippians_BP', 'Philippians_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2010 Philippians Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Finding Joy When Life Is HardPhilippians 1-403/21/2010Study Guide 2.The Great DescentPhilippians 203/28/2010Study Guide 1.Finding Joy When Life Is HardPhilippians 1-403/21/2010Study Guide 2.The Great DescentPhilippians 203/28/2010Study Guide\n\n\n2017 Philippians Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingPhilippians 1:1-3010/25/2017 2.TeachingPhilippians 2:1-1111/01/2017 3.TeachingPhilippians 2:12-3011/29/2017 4.TeachingPhilippians 312/06/2017 5.TeachingPhilippians 4:1-2312/13/2017 1.TeachingPhilippians 1:1-3010/25/2017 2.TeachingPhilippians 2:1-1111/01/2017 3.TeachingPhilippians 2:12-3011/29/2017 4.TeachingPhilippians 312/06/2017 5.TeachingPhilippians 4:1-2312/13/2017\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Colossians.html":{"url":"Colossians.html","title":"Colossians","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Paul had never met them, but they knew who he\nwas and respected his leadership. Paul had worked with a man named\nEpaphras when he was in Ephesus. Epaphras was originally from\nColossae, about 100 miles to the east. Paul sent him to bring the good\nnews about Jesus to his city and to two other nearby cities, Laodicea\nand Hierapolis. Epaphras was later arrested and brought to Rome as a\nprisoner himself. Paul learned from him what was happening in those\ncities.\nThe Colossians were mostly Gentiles, but like the Galatians they were\nbeing pressured to follow the Jewish law and were adding extra rules\nand false teachings to the faith. Some of them were priding themselves\non having visions and getting secret spiritual knowledge. So Paul\nwrote them a letter to say, “When you’ve got Jesus the Messiah, you’ve\ngot it all!”\nPaul emphasizes that all things in heaven and earth were created by\nthe Son and were reconciled to God by the Son’s death on the\ncross. Christ possesses the fullness of God’s being. Since the\nColossians have been brought into the new kingdom of light, they can\nlive their faith to the fullest. They are to put on the new\nself,awaiting the time the Messiah will appear openly, revealing his\nglory.\n\nBible Project\n\nColossians Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Colossians_BP', 'Colossians_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2010 Colossians Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Dig Down, Grow Up, Stand FirmColossians 1-204/11/2010Study Guide 2.Taking Off The Old, Putting On The NewColossians 3-404/18/2010Study Guide 1.Dig Down, Grow Up, Stand FirmColossians 1-204/11/2010Study Guide 2.Taking Off The Old, Putting On The NewColossians 3-404/18/2010Study Guide\n\n\n2018 Colossians Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingColossians 1:1-1801/03/2018 2.TeachingColossians 1:21-2:2301/10/2018 3.TeachingColossians 3:1-2501/24/2018 4.TeachingColossians 401/31/2018 1.TeachingColossians 1:1-1801/03/2018 2.TeachingColossians 1:21-2:2301/10/2018 3.TeachingColossians 3:1-2501/24/2018 4.TeachingColossians 401/31/2018\n\n\nColossians Misc Selection\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.The Work of Sanctification (Brian Shannon)Colossians 303/01/2023 2.The Work of Sanctification Part II (Brian Shannon)Colossians 303/08/2023 1.The Work of Sanctification (Brian Shannon)Colossians 303/01/2023 2.The Work of Sanctification Part II (Brian Shannon)Colossians 303/08/2023\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"1Thessalonians.html":{"url":"1Thessalonians.html","title":"1 Thessalonians","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Jesus would not only\nreturn to heal and restore them but also bring justice against those\noppressing them.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2010 1 Thessalonians Series (Sundays)\n2018 1 Thessalonians Series (Mid Week)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible 1 Thessalonians Introduction\n\nAround AD 51, Paul, Silas and Timothy brought the message about Jesus\nthe Messiah to the city of Thessalonica. Many people became believers,\nbut there was a riot when Paul and Silas were accused of defying\nCaesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus\n(see Acts 17:1-9). They narrowly escaped with their lives and had to\nflee.\nA little later Paul became concerned that the believers in\nThessalonica might fall away from the faith due to the opposition they\nwere facing. So he sent Timothy to encourage them (as a Greek he could\nmake the trip more safely). When Timothy returned to Achaia with the\nwelcome news that the Thessalonians had remained faithful, Paul wrote\nto express his joy.\nIn this short letter, Paul first recalls his time in Thessalonica and\ngives thanks for their continuing faith, despite trials and\nchallenges. He teaches them to avoid sexual immorality, to love one\nanother sincerely, and to work hard to earn their own living.\nPaul then addresses a key pastoral question: What is the Christian\nhope for those who have died? He explains that believers who die\nbefore the royal appearance of the Messiah are not lost, but will\nsurely be raised from the dead when he comes. He reminds the\nThessalonians that Jesus will appear suddenly and unexpectedly. They\nshould therefore live in such a way that they would be unashamed to\ngreet him. Throughout the letter Paul’s basic message is, “Keep up the\ngood work!”\n\nBible Project\n\n1 Thessalonians Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('1Thessalonians_BP', '1Thessalonians_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2010 1 Thessalonians Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\nNOTE: This series covers both First and Second Thessalonians\n\n\n 1.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 1)?1 Thess 1-304/25/2010Study Guide 2.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 2)?1 Thess 4-505/02/2010Study Guide 3.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 3)?2 Thess05/09/2010Study Guide 1.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 1)?1 Thess 1-304/25/2010Study Guide 2.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 2)?1 Thess 4-505/02/2010Study Guide 3.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 3)?2 Thess05/09/2010Study Guide\n\n\n2018 1 Thessalonians Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Teaching1 Thess 102/07/2018 2.Teaching1 Thess 2-302/14/2018 3.Teaching1 Thess 402/21/2018 4.Teaching1 Thess 503/07/2018 1.Teaching1 Thess 102/07/2018 2.Teaching1 Thess 2-302/14/2018 3.Teaching1 Thess 402/21/2018 4.Teaching1 Thess 503/07/2018\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"2Thessalonians.html":{"url":"2Thessalonians.html","title":"2 Thessalonians","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

The day of the\nLord was a phrase from the Hebrew prophets to describe God’s key\nvictory over every opponent, when his faithful ones would be\nrewarded. The Thessalonians’ concern seems to have been not that the\nday had come and gone and they had missed it, but that it was now\npresent. That would mean nothing more was to be expected from God in\nterms of setting things right. Since they continued to suffer\npersecutions, this was a depressing prospect.\nEven before he contradicts this false report, Paul reassures the\nThessalonians that God will indeed pay back all those who were\ntroubling them. He reminds them of the details he had discussed with\nthem in person of how the day of the Lord would arrive. He then\nrepeats some instruction from his earlier letter, urging them not to\nbe idle but to work hard and earn their own livings.\nAt the end of the letter, most of which would have been written by a\nscribe, Paul adds a greeting in his own handwriting. He wants them to\nknow for sure this teaching is really coming from him!\n\nBible Project\n\n2 Thessalonians Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('2Thessalonians_BP', '2Thessalonians_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2010 2 Thessalonians Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\nNOTE: This series covers both First and Second Thessalonians\n\n\n 1.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 1)?1 Thess 1-304/25/2010Study Guide 2.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 2)?1 Thess 4-505/02/2010Study Guide 3.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 3)?2 Thess05/09/2010Study Guide 1.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 1)?1 Thess 1-304/25/2010Study Guide 2.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 2)?1 Thess 4-505/02/2010Study Guide 3.What Does the Lord's Return Mean (Part 3)?2 Thess05/09/2010Study Guide\n\n\n2018 2 Thessalonians Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Teaching2 Thess 105/02/2018 2.Teaching2 Thess 2:1-1205/09/2018 3.Teaching2 Thess 2:13-3:1805/16/2018 1.Teaching2 Thess 105/02/2018 2.Teaching2 Thess 2:1-1205/09/2018 3.Teaching2 Thess 2:13-3:1805/16/2018\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"1Timothy.html":{"url":"1Timothy.html","title":"1 Timothy","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Throughout the book,\nwe see that what a church believes will directly shape how its members\nlive and behave.\nThe church's theology and beliefs must constantly be critiqued and\nformed by the Bible and the Gospel message. Churches should be known\nfor their devotion to the risen King Jesus and model integrity, good\nworks, and service to the poor and most vulnerable.\nIn 1 Timothy, we read about a holistic vision of the nature and\nmission of the Church. Just as in Timothy's time, corrupt teachers can\nconfuse believers, but Paul instructs on how the Church and its\nleaders can stay faithful to the way of Jesus.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2010 1 Timothy Series (Sundays)\n2018 1 Timothy Series (Mid Week)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible 1 Timothy Introduction\n\nAfter Paul was released from prison in Rome, he discovered that\nleaders in the Ephesian church had distorted the genuine message they\nhad first heard from Paul himself. They had misapplied certain Jewish\npractices and borrowed some others from the philosophies of the\nday. They restricted certain foods, forbade marriage and stressed\ncontroversial speculations as the path to spiritual progress. At the\nsame time, they tolerated immoral behavior. So Paul sent his co-worker\nTimothy to Ephesus and wrote him a letter, which he was expected to\nshare with the church. He hoped it would give Timothy the power and\ninfluence to set things in order until Paul could get to Ephesus\nhimself.\nPaul’s focus is on what true leadership in the church looks like. This\nwould help the Ephesians reject those who weren’t qualified and\nreplace them with those who were. Paul includes a special warning\ntoward the end of his letter about the dangers of greed, which seemed\nto be at the root of their problems.\nThroughout the letter Paul uses the phrase Christ Jesus - that is,\nMessiah Jesus - which emphasizes the kingly rule of Jesus. This helped\nremind the church that Jesus is their real leader and is the clearest\nmodel of authentic leadership.\n\nBible Project\n\n1 Timothy Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('1Timothy_BP', '1Timothy_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\nAs of 12/2023 Spoken Gospel has no 1 Timothy introduction\n\n2010 1 Timothy Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Instructions for the Church1 Timothy 1-205/23/2010 2.Pastors, Elders, Deacons & All: Setting The Example1 Timothy 3-405/30/2010 3.Helping Others, Giving Generously, and Fight for the Faith1 Timothy 5-606/06/2010 1.Instructions for the Church1 Timothy 1-205/23/2010 2.Pastors, Elders, Deacons & All: Setting The Example1 Timothy 3-405/30/2010 3.Helping Others, Giving Generously, and Fight for the Faith1 Timothy 5-606/06/2010\n\n\n2018 1 Timothy Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Teaching1 Timothy 105/30/2018 2.Teaching1 Timothy 1:8-2:406/06/2018 3.Teaching1 Timothy 2:5-1106/13/2018 4.Teaching1 Timothy 2:12-3:206/20/2018 5.Teaching1 Timothy 306/27/2018 6.Teaching1 Timothy 407/11/2018 7.Teaching1 Timothy 507/25/2018 8.Teaching1 Timothy 608/01/2018 1.Teaching1 Timothy 105/30/2018 2.Teaching1 Timothy 1:8-2:406/06/2018 3.Teaching1 Timothy 2:5-1106/13/2018 4.Teaching1 Timothy 2:12-3:206/20/2018 5.Teaching1 Timothy 306/27/2018 6.Teaching1 Timothy 407/11/2018 7.Teaching1 Timothy 507/25/2018 8.Teaching1 Timothy 608/01/2018\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"2Timothy.html":{"url":"2Timothy.html","title":"2 Timothy","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Paul had\nordered both Alexander and Hymenaeus to step down from leadership, but\nthey were continuing to oppose Paul. Others had joined them, and they\nwere still misdirecting people into a corrupted version of the faith\nthat stressed debate and dissension rather than purity and\nobedience.

He therefore left his long-time co-worker Timothy\nin that city with a letter authorizing him to replace these leaders\nand restore order. A similar situation on the island of Crete required\nPaul to commission another long-time co-worker, Titus, to act as his\nrepresentative there.\nPaul’s letter is addressed to Titus, but it is meant for the larger\nchurch as well. He confers his own authority on Titus and instructs\nhim to appoint godly leaders. Paul’s description of the false teaching\nmatches that in Ephesus: a combination of selective Jewish observances\n(such as being circumcised and abstaining from certain foods) and the\npursuit of controversial speculations. However, the teaching didn’t\nhelp people live purer lives. Paul tells the community that the grace\nof God has appeared that offers salvation to all people.It is the true\nmessage about Jesus that helps God’s people live a new kind of\nlife. Paul reveals his plan to spend the winter in Nicopolis, a city\non the west coast of Macedonia. It would provide an excellent\njumping-off point for bringing the gospel to the western part of the\nempire.

It's written to\nPhilemon whose slave Onesimus ran away and became a believer under\nPaul's teaching.\nPaul urges Philemon to forgive Onesimus and accept him back as an\nequal. Because they are both followers of Jesus, God's grace has made\nthem partners under the new humanity that Jesus has established.\nWhile Paul doesn't mention Jesus' death and resurrection directly in\nthis letter, he offers to take on any punishment Onesimus deserves, a\ndemonstration of what Jesus did on the cross. He encourages Philemon\nto do the same as he reconciles to Onesimus before God.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2010 Philemon Series (Sundays)\n2018 Philemon Series (Mid Week)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Philemon Introduction\n\nOne of the people Paul chose to deliver the letters we know as\nColossians and Ephesians was a man named Onesimus. Onesimus was\noriginally from Colossae, and would have been known to the people\nthere. But Paul was compelled to write a separate letter for him. This\nwas because Onesimus had been the slave of a wealthy Colossian named\nPhilemon, in whose home the church met. Onesimus had run away,\nprobably robbing Philemon in the process. In Rome he had become a\nfollower of Jesus. He’d been helping Paul in prison, but now Paul\nneeded him to return to Colossae. Paul’s hope was that Philemon would\nnot only forgive Onesimus, but welcome him as a brother and no longer\na slave.\nPaul’s brief letter to Philemon stresses the change in Onesimus’s\nlife. His name meant useful in Greek, and Paul tells Philemon that\nwhile he had formerly been useless (a servant Philemon couldn’t count\non), now he could be useful to both of them.

The\nrecipients are Jesus-believing Jews who are in danger of falling away\nfrom the faith. They are likely in Italy, since the author passes on\ngreetings to them from those who are from Italy—probably their friends\nwho are traveling elsewhere. The goal of the whole book is to show the\nsuperiority of the final realities God has revealed in the new\ncovenant to the temporary ones of the first covenant. Its readers are\nencouraged to respond to the threat of persecution by recommitting to\nthe new reality brought by Jesus.\nThe book alternates between teachings—reviews of Israel’s history or\nthe temple worship arrangements—and challenges based on these\nteachings. There are four teaching-challenge pairs:\n\nJesus and the salvation he brings are greater than the angels and\nthe salvation they announced (the law of Moses).\n\nJesus is our “apostle” (someone sent by God on a specific mission),\nand he brings us into a greater rest and promised land than Moses\nand Joshua brought Israel into.\n\nJesus is a more effective high priest than the priests appointed by\nthe law of Moses.\n\nAs God’s faithful people have done throughout the ages, we must\ncontinue living in light of God’s unseen heavenly realities and\nstepping out in faith.

He\npersonally understands what it means to suffer and how pain makes us\nvulnerable to shame, doubt, lust, deception, anger, and pride. But he\nalso knows that in suffering, there’s a unique opportunity for God to\nperfect and complete the valuable character-building work he started\nin us.\nGod meets us with wisdom as we face the tests of life. When we listen\nclosely to his wise words of truth, trusting that he is good and\nresponding with action, we begin to experience the wholeness God\ndesigned us for. And those around us experience it too. \nWhen we see our sufferings through the wisdom and goodness of God, we\nare moved to alleviate human suffering whenever we encounter it,\nespecially the sufferings of the most vulnerable in our communities.\nBut when we forget God’s goodness, we often allow our own pain to\nprovoke selfish actions and cruel words that destroy our\ncommunities. There’s a lot at stake, so James urges us to listen\ncarefully and respond tangibly.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2010 James Series (Sundays)\n2019 James Series (Mid Week)\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible James Introduction\n\nJames, one of the brothers of Jesus, became a leader of the church in\nJerusalem after Jesus’ death and resurrection. He was respected for\nthe advice he gave and for the wise decisions he helped the community\nof believers make (see Acts 15:13-21). At one point he decided to\nwrite down some of his best teachings and advice and send them to\nother Jewish believers in Jesus who were scattered throughout the\nRoman Empire. What he wrote to them has become known as the book of\nJames.\nThis book begins like a letter because it’s being sent to people at a\ndistance. But it is actually not very much like other letters of the\ntime. It is a collection of short sayings and slightly longer\ndiscussions of practical topics. The conversational style, the short,\npithy sayings and the interweaving of themes all make this book\nsimilar to the wisdom writing found in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes.\nLike those wisdom books, James concentrates on questions of daily\nliving in God’s good creation. He considers such practical issues as\nconcern for the poor, the responsible use of wealth, control of the\ntongue, purity of life, unity in the community of Christ-followers,\nand above all patience and endurance during times of trial. The godly\nwisdom here remains as valuable a guide to living fully human lives as\nwhen James first shared it centuries ago.\n\nBible Project\n\nJames Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('James_BP', 'James_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\nAs of 12/2023 Spoken Gospel has no james introduction\n\n2010 James Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Ten Marks of Maturity - Part 1/5James 110/31/2010Study Guide 2.Ten Marks of Maturity - Part 2/5James 211/07/2010Study Guide 3.Ten Marks of Maturity - Part 3/5James 311/14/2010Study Guide 4.Ten Marks of Maturity - Part 4/5James 412/05/2010Study Guide 5.Ten Marks of Maturity - Part 5/5James 512/12/2010Study Guide 1.Ten Marks of Maturity - Part 1/5James 110/31/2010Study Guide 2.Ten Marks of Maturity - Part 2/5James 211/07/2010Study Guide 3.Ten Marks of Maturity - Part 3/5James 311/14/2010Study Guide 4.Ten Marks of Maturity - Part 4/5James 412/05/2010Study Guide 5.Ten Marks of Maturity - Part 5/5James 512/12/2010Study Guide\n\n\n2019 James Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingJames 1:1-804/24/2019 2.TeachingJames 1:9-2005/01/2019 3.TeachingJames 1:21-2:905/08/2019 4.TeachingJames 2:10-2605/29/2019 5.TeachingJames 306/19/2019 6.TeachingJames 4:1-706/26/2019 7.TeachingJames 4:8-1607/17/2019 8.TeachingJames 4:13-17, 5:1-607/31/2019 9.TeachingJames 5:7-2008/14/2019 1.TeachingJames 1:1-804/24/2019 2.TeachingJames 1:9-2005/01/2019 3.TeachingJames 1:21-2:905/08/2019 4.TeachingJames 2:10-2605/29/2019 5.TeachingJames 306/19/2019 6.TeachingJames 4:1-706/26/2019 7.TeachingJames 4:8-1607/17/2019 8.TeachingJames 4:13-17, 5:1-607/31/2019 9.TeachingJames 5:7-2008/14/2019\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"1Peter.html":{"url":"1Peter.html","title":"1 Peter","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Peter spent the final years of his\nlife and ministry—in the early 60s AD—as a leader of the church in\nRome. When he learned that churches in other Roman provinces (all\nlocated in what is now Turkey) were experiencing persecution, he wrote\nto urge them to remain faithful to Jesus. Peter’s letter was delivered\nby Silas, a man who also worked with the apostle Paul (see Acts\n15:22–17:15). Peter introduces Silas and explains that he helped to\ncompose the letter.\nAfter the opening, the letter has three main sections:\n\nPeter first tells his readers to be holy in all you do.As Gentiles\nthey once lived in ignorance (they did not know the ways of\nGod). But they are now a holy nation, part of God’s own people, and\nare called to a new way of life.\n\nPeter then explains how this way of life will impress those who\nmight accuse and persecute them without just cause.\n\nFinally, Peter acknowledges that his readers are suffering for their\nfaith, but he explains that this is only to be expected. The Messiah\nhimself suffered, and believers all over the world are facing the\nsame challenge. The followers of Jesus are waiting for the day God\nwill visit them, and even in their suffering they can show they\nbelong to God.\n\n\n\nBible Project\n\n1 Peter Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('1Peter_BP', '1Peter_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2011 1 Peter Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.How To Live Until Jesus Comes - Part 1/51 Peter 101/09/2011Study Guide 2.How To Live Until Jesus Comes - Part 2/51 Peter 201/16/2011Study Guide 3.How To Live Until Jesus Comes - Part 3/51 Peter 3-401/23/2011Study Guide 4.How To Live Until Jesus Comes - Part 4/51 Peter 4-501/30/2011Study Guide 1.How To Live Until Jesus Comes - Part 1/51 Peter 101/09/2011Study Guide 2.How To Live Until Jesus Comes - Part 2/51 Peter 201/16/2011Study Guide 3.How To Live Until Jesus Comes - Part 3/51 Peter 3-401/23/2011Study Guide 4.How To Live Until Jesus Comes - Part 4/51 Peter 4-501/30/2011Study Guide\n\n\n2019 1 Peter Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Teaching1 Peter 1:1-808/21/2019 2.Teaching1 Peter 1:6-1608/28/2019 3.Teaching1 Peter 1:13-2:309/04/2019 4.Teaching1 Peter 2:4-1209/11/2019 5.Teaching1 Peter 2:13-3:709/18/2019 6.Teaching1 Peter 3:8-2209/25/2019 7.Teaching1 Peter 410/02/2019 8.Teaching1 Peter 510/09/2019 1.Teaching1 Peter 1:1-808/21/2019 2.Teaching1 Peter 1:6-1608/28/2019 3.Teaching1 Peter 1:13-2:309/04/2019 4.Teaching1 Peter 2:4-1209/11/2019 5.Teaching1 Peter 2:13-3:709/18/2019 6.Teaching1 Peter 3:8-2209/25/2019 7.Teaching1 Peter 410/02/2019 8.Teaching1 Peter 510/09/2019\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"2Peter.html":{"url":"2Peter.html","title":"2 Peter","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Since he was an\neyewitness of the ministry of Jesus, he decided to write another\nletter to the believers he had written to before, confirming what they\nhad been taught about Jesus. False teachers were proposing that, since\nJesus hadn’t returned already, his return couldn’t be expected at\nall. Because they didn’t expect any future judgment, they were living\nimmoral lives. (Peter likely learned about the threat of these\nteachers from a letter sent by Jude, a brother of Jesus, to warn\nbelievers against them. Peter’s letter echoes Jude’s, but in shorter\nform. See Jude.)\nPeter answers the false teachers by stressing that he personally saw\nthe glory and majesty of Jesus on the sacred mountain (see Mark\n9:2-13). Everyone will see this glory when Jesus returns. In powerful\nimagery Peter describes the false teachers’ destructive effect on the\ncommunity and the judgment that awaits them. In the final section of\nhis letter, Peter explains that the Messiah’s return has been delayed\nbecause God wants everyone to repent.

Some of them had abandoned\nfaith in Jesus the Messiah as it had first been taught to them. They\nfound the proclamation that God had come in a human body impossible to\nreconcile with the common Greek idea that the flesh is evil and only\nspirit is good. But despite their denial of the Messiah, their immoral\nlives and their lack of practical love, they claimed to know God and\nbelong to God. They asserted that their spiritual insight put them\nabove the rest of the group, which they demonstrated by deserting the\nfellowship. Those left behind were deeply shaken, uncertain about\neverything they had been taught.\nSomeone who was close to this community and who had been an eyewitness\nof Jesus wrote to reassure them of what they had heard from the\nbeginning. The author doesn’t identify himself, but very likely he was\nthe apostle John. Much of the language is similar to the Gospel of\nJohn. The letter testifies to the reality of the Messiah’s coming in\nthe flesh, reassuring the believers that they have full access to the\ntruth. It emphasizes godly living and practical caring as the signs of\nthose who genuinely know God.\n\nBible Project\n\n1 John Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('1-3John_BP', '1-3John_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2011 1 John Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Love and Truth - Part 1/31 John 1-202/13/2011Study Guide 2.Love and Truth - Part 2/31 John 3-502/20/2011Study Guide 3.Love and Truth - Part 3/32 John02/27/2011Study Guide 1.Love and Truth - Part 1/31 John 1-202/13/2011Study Guide 2.Love and Truth - Part 2/31 John 3-502/20/2011Study Guide 3.Love and Truth - Part 3/32 John02/27/2011Study Guide\n\n\n2020 1 John Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Teaching1 John 2:1-2312/04/2019 2.Teaching1 John 2:18-3:301/08/2020 3.Teaching1 John 3:3-2401/15/2020 4.Teaching1 John 4-501/22/2020 1.Teaching1 John 2:1-2312/04/2019 2.Teaching1 John 2:18-3:301/08/2020 3.Teaching1 John 3:3-2401/15/2020 4.Teaching1 John 4-501/22/2020\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"2John.html":{"url":"2John.html","title":"2 John","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

Much less\nis known about Jude than James (see James), but he was clearly a\nchurch leader, since he wrote to believers with authority in this\nletter that bears his name. It cannot be determined exactly who was\nmeant to receive the letter, although the references to angels, to\nIsrael’s history and to specific writings indicate that Jewish\nChristians were in view.\nJude addresses the problem of false teachers who have come and are now\nthreatening the faith that was once for all entrusted to God’s holy\npeople. On the basis of supposedly inspired dreams, they reject\nauthority and pollute their own bodies. Even though they claim to be\nbringing God’s message, they really follow mere natural instincts and\ndo not have the Spirit. The believers must actively resist them and\ncleanse their community by rejecting both the teaching and the example\nof these ungodly men.\nIt seems that the apostle Peter received a copy of Jude’s letter and\nwrote a similar one of his own to show that it faithfully presented\nthe teaching of the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ (see 2 Peter).\n\nBible Project\n\nJude Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Jude_BP', 'Jude_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n2011 Jude Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.It's Worth Fighting For!Jude03/06/2011Study Guide 1.It's Worth Fighting For!Jude03/06/2011Study Guide\n\n\n2020 Jude Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.TeachingJude02/12/2020 1.TeachingJude02/12/2020\n\n\n withFW( ()=>fw.pageSetup() ) "},"Revelation.html":{"url":"Revelation.html","title":"Revelation","keywords":"","body":"\n  window.withFWQue = window.withFWQue || [];\n  window.withFW    = window.withFW    || function(fn) {\n    const fnName = fn.name || 'anonymous';\n    if (window.fw) {\n      // generate a VERBOSE logging probe\n      // ... typically don't want to see\n      //     BECAUSE will generate A LOT OF ENTRIES (the happy path)\n      window.withFWLog.v(`executing function '${fnName}' IMMEDIATELY ... fw.js HAS BEEN expanded`);\n\n      // process NOW\n      fn();\n    }\n    else {\n      // generate a FORCED logging probe\n      // ... of interest to insure our cache is working\n      //     AND FEW ENTRIES (during bootstrap of initial load of site)\n      // ...

While in exile on the island of Patmos, a Jewish Christian\nprophet named John received a vision showing that the cult of emperor\nworship would soon become deadly to followers of the Messiah. The book\nof Revelation (or Apocalypse, meaning unveiling) is a warning,\ncirculated to seven cities in the Roman province of Asia Minor. John’s\nmain point is to challenge and encourage the believers in the midst of\ntheir opposition and persecution.\nRevelation is an apocalypse, a literary form well known in John’s\nday. In an apocalypse a visitor from heaven reveals the secrets of the\nunseen world and the future through vivid symbols. While the symbols\nmay appear strange at first, they become more clear when seen in their\nfirst-century setting and in light of other Bible imagery.\nJohn’s vision has four main parts, each marked by the phrase in the\nSpirit. After words of warning and encouragement to each of the seven\nchurches, John’s visions then center on Jesus—his role in redemption\nand the judgments he brings to the world. The immoral political and\neconomic forces that rebel against God will be destroyed, and the\nMessiah will triumph over all his enemies. The vision closes with the\npromise that God’s faithful servants will reign over the new creation.\nRevelation also functions as the appropriate conclusion to the entire\ndrama of the Bible. John concludes with images from the garden of\nEden, the first story in the Bible. The world will experience a fresh\nbeginning: He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making\neverything new!”\n\nBible Project\n\nRevelation Introduction\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addZoomableImage('Revelation_BP', 'Revelation_BP.png', 75) )\n\n\n\n\nPart 1: Rev 1-11 ...\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Rev 12-22\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\nAs of 3/2022 Spoken Gospel has no Revelation introduction\n\n2011 Revelation Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n 1.Unlocking RevelationRev 103/13/2011Study Guide 2.Return to Your First Love -

The playback automatically loops until\nyou click stop, making it easy to hear the scripture\ncontinuously. When using this feature on your phone, you can simply\npop in your earbuds and let the scripture take root in your\nmemory!\n\nYou can choose your preferred Bible translation from a selection of\nthe most popular versions.  Your choice will be remembered for\neach individual passage (once it is explicitly selected)!\n\nA scripture link is provided to the You Version\nBible App, so you can explore the passage in greater depth.\n\nAs always, you can track your progress by checking the completion\nbox next to the passages you've memorized!\n\n?? OLD: The Navigators' approach to scripture\nmemorization involves reciting the scripture reference both before\nand after the passage. It's important not to forget the\n'address'! :-) However, because our audio playback automatically\nloops, this effect has been implicitly achieved. As a result, the\naudio only announces the reference at the beginning (along with the\nBible translation).\n\nRegarding the audio playback: \n\nI follow the Navigators' approach\nto Scripture memorization, which involves reciting the Scripture\nreference both before and after the passage. Remembering the\n'address' is important! :-)\n\nAdditionally, I find it helpful to include a brief context of the\nScripture (in the first reference) and specify the translation\nused (in the second reference).\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, there are only a few passages on this page.  I am following\nthe 25 in 25 campaign, and\nwill be adding passages from that resource throughout the year.\nIn addition, I plan to add more scriptures to this list.  If you have\none that you would like added, please reach out to me\nat \n\n  withFW( ()=>fw.addInquire('Add%20Memory%20Scripture') )\n\n\nLord Bless You!\n\n\n\n\nJanuary Flyer for 25 in 25 campaign\n\n\n  Luke 9:23-24 (Discipleship)      NIVESVNLTNKJVKJVCSB  Clear SelectionJesus delineates a true ChristianThen he said to them all: \"Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.

Set against the backdrop\nof Roman oppression in first-century Israel, the seven-season show\nshares an authentic and intimate look at Jesus’ revolutionary life and\nteachings.\nThe Chosen is based on the true stories of the Gospels of Jesus\nChrist. Some locations and timelines have been combined or\ncondensed. Backstories and some characters or dialog have been added.\nHowever, all the bible and historical context and any artistic\nimagination are designed to support the truth and intention of the\nScriptures. Viewers are encouraged to read the scripture and the\nGospels.\n\nIt's Free!\nThe Chosen uses a \"crowdfunding\" approach, so it's completely free\nto watch.  They utilize a \"Pay it Forward\" model, so you can\ncontribute if you wish, offsetting some of their costs, keeping\nthe show free.\nFrom the onset of Season 2, they will pre-release a new season in\ntheaters for a short time.  After that, they will make the new\nseason available through their free app.\n\nIs it for me?\n\nWatching The Chosen is a matter of conscience.  Some Christians\nappreciate the retelling of Jesus’ life, while others have\ndifficulty with the artistic license involved with portraying Jesus’\nlife on film (and that's OK).\nI personally fall in the former camp.  This is not like any other\n\"religious program\" you have seen before.  It simply brings the\nbiblical characters to life, and you realize they had many of the same\nexperiences and struggles that we do today.\nI would encourage you to prayerfully discern whether watching the show\nwill be a benefit or a hindrance to your walk with the Lord.\n\nWhy I created this page\nThis page was created to have a concise and consolidated set of links\nto the various (somewhat disjointed) resources (i.e. the streaming\nservice, deep dives, and devotions).\nConsistent with all \"Fire Within\" studies, you have the\n\"completion status\" check boxes - to help keep track of where you are\nat in the series.\n\nRelease Dates\n\nSeason 1: 04/21/2019\nSeason 2: 04/04/2021\nSeason 3: 11/05/2022\nSeason 4: 06/02/2024\nSeason 5: TBD\nSeason 6: TBD\nSeason 7: TBD\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nInstall the Apps?\nWhen you have installed the appropriate applications (i.e. \"The\nChosen App\", or the \"YouVersion Bible App\"), the links below will be\nserviced by the app itself.

Typically it is recommended to install the apps\n(it's really your preference).\n\nCasting\nEven though you are streaming an episode from your mobile device,\nyou can cast it to your SmartTV, allowing everyone to enjoy it\ntogether.\nHere are some instructions that walk you through the process:\nHow to cast to your TV?\n\nDescriptions\nDescriptions have been compiled for both the series, and each\nepisode.

Because you \"synced\" this from\nyour old account (in Step 1), you will not loose any of your\ndata.\n\nAs always, retain the Email/Password you used for this account\n(in the same way to do for other accounts).\n\n\n\nFor all other devices that you are using (cell phone, tablet, etc.),\n\nSimply \"Sign Out\" of your old phone-based account,\n\nAnd \"Sign In\" to your new email/password account.\nNOTE: Here you are using \"Sign In\" (because you have created\nthis account in Step 2 - which used \"Sign Up\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  v21.4 - Update Current Sermon Series (May 22, 2024)\n\n\n\nUpdate Current Romans Series (Sundays)\nUpdate Current 1 Kings Series (Mid Week)\nAdded \"My Small Group\" section in Acts\n\n\n\n\n  v21.3 - Update Current Sermon Series (May 13, 2024)\n\n\n\nUpdate Current Romans Series (Sundays)\nUpdate Current 2 Samuel Series (Mid Week)\nUpdate Current 1 Kings Series (Mid Week)\n\n\n\n\n  v21.2 - Misc (Mar 5, 2024)\n\n\n\nThe Chosen refinements:\nRe-formated the sections of the Overview/Usage and added \"Casting Instructions\".\nAdded a \"crowdfunding\" description in Overview.\nStreamlined the main \"Bible App\" links for each season.\nAdded devotion day indicators (ex: Devotion-3), making it easier to correlate manually.\nDevotion-3 of Season 2 has been fixed on the Bible App.  Applied this to Episode 4 and added scriptures.\n\n\nAdded Marriage & Divorce series in Current Events (under Specials).\n\n\n\n\n  v21.1 - The Chosen, & more (Feb 27, 2024)\n\n\n\nThe Chosen page is now available, that consolidates\nlinks for the series/episodes, and devotions!\nAdded the new 2024 Romans series (ongoing), and noted the\n2009 series has been archived.\nAdded Abraham genealogy diagram to Genesis.\nAdded the new Genesis Small Group sessions, starting in 03/03/2024.\nAdded new Spoken Gospel Overview for Zephaniah.\nUpdated the Christmas section with the current 2023 entry, and\nadded \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" from 1965.\nAdded \"The God Delusion Debate\" - Richard Dawkins vs John Lennox\nin the Moral Decay section of Current Events\n(under Specials).\nStandardized ALL Table-of-Content entries to include Sunday/Mid-Week delineators.\nAdded the 1/14/2024 Romans sermon to the LGBTQ section of\nCurrent Events.\n\n\n\n\n  v21.0 - Device Sync (Feb 21, 2024)\n\n\n\nThis is a Major Release that allows you to synchronize your state\nacross all of your devices (laptop, phone, tablet, etc.)!

This will set the stage for adding ALL\nbooks of the Bible to a future release (stay tuned).\nSimplified the blog build process (i.e. the 'blog:dev' npm\nscript), executing the gitbook command directly in the npm script,\neliminating the FireWithin/buildDocsInDev.js script\ncompletely.

It's not exactly where things\nbegin, but it certainly is where the things of this world will end!\nThe current state of our world made me realize that something was\nnot right.  Everything seemed upside down.  This caused me to start\nthinking about end times (prompted by my previous Church\nbackground, and the prodding of the Holy Spirit)!\nIf you had told me a few years ago, that I was interested in\nRevelation, I would have laughed :-) It is so symbolic and elusive.\nThis is one topic where assistance is most appreciated (from a\ntrusted source).
