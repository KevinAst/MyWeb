Within\n \nWelcome to my \"Fire Within\" Bible Study Guide!\nYou may have guessed that I am a believer and follower of Jesus Christ\n(i.e. a Christian).  The short version of my faith is I accepted\nChrist at an early age, and was active in my Church for many years.\nHowever I felt something lacking in my faith.  I actually fell away\nfrom God much later in life, and through a series of (what I believe\nwere miraculous events), God called me back into His fold.  Through\nthe empowerment of the Holy Spirit, I now have a passion to be in His\nword daily, allowing it to guide my life and decisions.\nI share more about my Christian faith in the My Faith section.\nTechnology\nTechnology has radically changed the vast amount of resources that are\ninstantly available to us all ... even as believers!\nYou can install the You Version Bible App\n(on your phone) which contains the entire Bible (any version)\n... held right in the palm of your hand!  From this you can read\nthe scriptures, or stream an audible reading of God's word during your\ncommute or work-out.\nIn addition you can find an abundance of Bible study resources on the\ninternet.  The problem is they are somewhat disjointed\nand difficult to organize and keep track of (in the context of a\nBible study).\nAs a result I created this site.  It is merely an accumulation of\nresource links that guide me through the books of the Bible.  Because\nthey are concisely organized, it helps in keeping track of where you\nare in your study.\nHow I Study\nEveryone is going to have their own preference on how they study the\nBible.  In my case, I have found that it helps me to supplement the\nreading of Gods word with a sermon series from a trusted evangelical\npastor.  It simply adds more background and insight that makes the\nscriptures come alive.  This of course this is in addition to\nprayer - asking the Holy Spirit for discernment and\nguidance.\nWhen I study a book of the Bible, I follow this pattern:\n\nI like a high-level orientation to the book.  What is the\nbackground?  Who are the main characters.  Why was the book\nwritten and what is it's major theme and emphasis?\n\nIn some cases, I may audibly stream the entire book at a time.\nI am a slow reader, so streaming is a good option for me.\n\nFor the actual study, I will read (or audibly stream) a few\nchapters at a time.\n\nI then supplement what I have read with the sermon series that I\nmentioned above.\n\nRepeat steps 3 and 4 through the completion of the book :-)\n\n\nResources\nRegarding the trusted set of resources found on this site, I am\npromoting the following:\n\nFor the high-level orientation of each book, I offer three\nresources: Overview Bible, Bible Project, and\nSpoken Gospel.  You are free to use all of them, or simply\nchoose the one that you prefer.  The first two use a presentation\nstyle, where the later is more of a contemporary video series.\n\nRegarding the main resource containing the sermon series on each\nbook, I am using Cornerstone Chapel (with Pastor Gary\nHamrick).  This is a non denominational evangelical church in\nLeesburg, VA. I have grown to love the ministry of Pastor Gary.  He\nprovides so much insight to the scriptures, making them simply come\nalive (somewhat akin to watching The\nChosen series on the\nlife of Christ ).\n\n\nI am so grateful for these biblical resources, and the men and women\nof God that have made them possible.\n\nPlease note that this Bible Study Guide is not yet complete.  To\nrequest a specific book to be added, please see the\nWork In Progress section.\n\nGod Bless You\nI pray that you find these resources useful in your personal Bible\nStudy.  May God bless you in your walk with Christ!\nIn Him,\n\n\n\n  addInquire('Fire%20Within%20Feedback');\n\n\nP.S.: To get the most out of this site, I recommend\ntaking a peek at the Getting Started section!\n"},"start.html":{"url":"start.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\n\n\nOverall the \"Fire Within\" Bible Study Guide is simple to use.\nIt is, at it's core, simply a consolidated list of resource links to\nhelp you in your Bible Study.  With that said, this section highlights\na number of things that you should know to get the most out of this\nsite.\nBasic Appearance\nYou can change the basic appearance of the site through the Text\nMenu, found in the upper-left of the page.  You can change the\n• text size • display font • and color theme (I prefer\nthe \"Night\" theme, giving you a dark mode).\n\n  \n\n\nGoing Home\nThe Home menu (found in the upper-right of the page) will take\nyou back to the wiiBridges home page.\n\n  \n\n\nLeft Nav Bar\nThe books of the Bible are accessed through the Left Nav Bar.\nThey are found in the Old and New Testament sections, which are\nthemselves expandable.  By simply clicking the desired book, you will\nwill be taken to the study resources for that book.\n\n  \n\n\nThe Left Nav Bar itself is expandable using the menu control found in\nthe upper-left of the page.  This control is a toggle that will either\nexpand or contract the Left Nav Bar.\n\n  \n\n\nResponsive Design\nThe Left Nav Bar will behave differently, depending on whether you\nuse it on a desktop (or tablet) or a smaller device (such as a cell\nphone).\n\nDesktop (or Tablet)\n\nBecause a desktop (or tablet) has more real estate to work with ...\nThe Left Nav Bar will start out open and remain open as you navigate the site.\n\nPhone\n\nBecause a cell phone has less real estate to work with ...\nThe Left Nav Bar will start out closed and automatically close on each menu selection.\nAs an example, to select a book in the New Testament (assuming you\nare not already in the New Testament), you will need to:\nexpand the Left Nav Bar\nselect \"New Testament\"\n... the New Testament splash page will display, and the Left Nav Bar will close\nexpand the Left Nav Bar once again\n... the New Testament menu has now expanded\nselect the desired book (ex: Acts)\n\n\n\n\nResource Links\nAs mentioned in the Welcome Page, this site is merely an\naccumulation of resource links that guide me through the books of the\nBible.  Because they are concisely organized, it helps in keeping\ntrack of where you are your study.\n\n  Desktop Rendition\n  \n\n\n\nA word about the resource links found in this site ... they will\nconsistently take you to another tab in your browser.  This is done\npurposefully, so you won't loose your place in your study.  To get\nback to this page, simply re-select it in your browser tabs.\n\nResponsive Design\nThe layout of the sermon series links will have a slightly different\nappearance, depending on whether you use it on a desktop (or tablet)\nor a smaller device (such as a cell phone).\n\nDesktop (or Tablet)\n\nA desktop (or tablet) has more real estate to work with on your\nscreen.\nThe sermon series will have a more horizontal layout (with up\nto 5 columns).\n\nPhone\n\nWhile a cell phone has less real estate, it is useful if you want to\nstream audio during your commute or workout.\nThe sermon series will have a more vertical layout (with only\n3 columns).\nIf you have the You Version\nBible App installed on your phone, the scripture references will be\nserviced by the Bible App!\nRemember - you can always cast a sermon series from your phone to a TV!\n\n\n\n  Phone Rendition\n  \n\n\n\nWhere Am I?\nIt can sometimes be hard to remember where you left off in your study\n... especially when there are a large number of lessons in a series.\nFor that reason, you will find a \"Completed Checkbox\" for each lesson\nof a Sermon Series.  By simply clicking the checkbox, it will be\nremembered the next time you come back.\n\n  \n\n\n\nPlease understand that the \"Complete Checkbox\" state is held in your\nlocal device.  That means the status will not follow you when you\nuse multiple devices (say a laptop and a cell phone).  In other\nwords, it's really the status of the device you are using.\nThis feature is merely meant to be a convenience, and was\nimplemented using the simplest technique.\n\nDiagrams\nIn some cases, a presentation or sermon series will use a detailed\ndiagram to get their points across.  When this happens (and I have\nthe time), I will extract that diagram and make it available as one\nof the resources of this site.\nThese diagrams are typically fairly large, and may not be readable\nwhen restricted by the browser window.  As a result, I have added the\nfollowing features:\n\nYou can \"hover over the diagram\" with your mouse, and it will\nzoom/expand on that section.  On a cell phone you can \"press and\nhold\" your finger to get the same effect.\n\nYou can also \"click the diagram\" to open it in a new tab of your\nbrowser.\n\nfrom there you can re-orient the browser window so it is visible\nconcurrently with the video presentation\nyou can also print the diagram by using your browser controls\n\n\n\n\nTry this out for yourself with the following sample (taken from the\nRevelation series):\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('RevelationTimeline_CS2', 'RevelationTimeline_CS.png', 75);\n\n"},"WorkInProgress.html":{"url":"WorkInProgress.html","title":"Work In Progress","keywords":"","body":"Work In Progress\n\n\nYou may have noticed that this site is a work-in-progress.\nAt the time of this writing I have compiled only a small number of\nbooks in the Bible.

They look at it as a process of \"pulling yourself up by\nyour bootstraps\" ... to live a good enough life to be accepted into\nHeaven by God.  I can appreciate this concept because this is what all\nother religions strive for.\nThe truth of the matter is nothing could be further from the truth.\nIt is not possible for us to work our way into heaven with our \"good\nworks\".  The Bible tells us that our righteousness is like filthy rags\nbefore God (Isaiah 64:6).\nGod is Holy\nIn reality, there is a deep chasm between us and the Holy God.  It is\ndifficult to even comprehend how Holy our God is.  What separates us\nfrom God is our sinful nature, and there is nothing we can do in and\nof ourselves to bridge that gap.\nIn the Beginning\nIt wasn't always this way.  When God created the world, we had a pure\nrelationship with Him (in Adam and Eve).  However, God gave us free\nwill, and Adam and Eve chose to disobey God (and so by inference -\nus).  Hence ushered in the severing of our relationship with God.\nFrom that very moment in time, God formulated a plan to bring us back\ninto His fold.\nAm I good enough?\nYou might be saying, well I'm a pretty good person ... I look out for\nothers ... I'm not a cheat or a thief ... etc.  Those are all good\nthings, but it doesn't come close to the standard of a Holy God.\nJesus reveals that even what we think in our minds can be a sin\nMatthew 5:28\nThe Gospel\nThe Gospel is the Good News that salvation is God's free gift to us,\nbut we must accept it\n(John 14:6\nRomans 10:9-10).\nGod requires a sacrifice for the atonement of our sins.  This is what\nthe Old Testament sacrificial system was (a temporary one, which had\nto be repeated).  In reality, this was simply a picture (or a\nforetelling) of the ultimate sacrifice (a permanent one) ... that is\nof Jesus Christ.  Jesus (who is part of the triune God head - Father,\nSon, and Holy Ghost), who always existed, humbled himself and came to\nearth through a miraculous virgin birth.  He is both God and man.  He\nlived a sinless perfect life.  His ministry modeled the true\nrelationship we can have with God.  He was sacrificed on a cross (the\nmost brutal and shameful death imaginable), as a permanent atonement\nfor our sins.  He rose from the dead (the first of many saints), and\nascended into heaven, where he prepares a place for his followers.\nThe bible tells us that:\n\nAll have sinned\nRomans 3:10\nRomans 3:23\n\nThe results of sin is death ... but we don't have to experience\ndeath and hell, for God's gift to us is forgiveness and eternal life\nin heaven with Him.\nRomans 6:23\n\nIn order to receive this gift, you must believe that it is real and\nthat it can truly change your life. This is more than a simple\n\"head knowledge\".  It is an act of trusting Jesus with your heart,\nand turning your life over to Him.\nEphesians 2:8\nYou must confess Jesus as Lord.\nRomans 10:13\n\n\nSalvation is a free gift of God, offered to all who simply ask.\nIf you want to become a Christian, you must fervently\nbelieve in the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus, repent from your\nsin, and ask him to come into and change your life.  You can\nsimply pray this prayer:\n\nLord Jesus, I confess that I have sinned.\nI repent of my sin and turn to you.\nI believe that you died on the cross for me.\nThat you rose from the dead.\nThat you reign in heaven.\nI confess you as my Lord, and my Savior.\nI pledge my life to you from this day forward.\nFill me with your spirit, that I might be your servant.\nThank you for saving me.\nIn Jesus name.\nAmen\n\nThe truth of the matter is Christianity is less about religion, and\nmore about a personal relationship with God.\nIf you prayed this prayer, there are angels rejoicing in heaven\n(Luke 15:10)!  This reveals\njust how valuable you are to God and how much He desires for you to be\nwith Him in heaven forever!  A great victory has been won!  Your next\nstep is to seek out other believers, in a local Bible believing\nchurch, that can assist and disciple you in your new found faith!\nMy Faith\nIn my personal life, I made this profession of faith as a young boy,\nduring a revival of my parents church.\nI was active in my church, trying to live a life that honored God.  I\ncontinued that process into my adult days, raising my family and\ncontinuing to be active in my church.\nHowever, it seemed like I was missing something.  I would see other\nChristians that were \"on fire\" for the Lord.  I didn't have the\npassion to be in God's Word, and my prayer life was non-existent.  It\nseemed like I was merely going through the motions.\nIn 2005 I actually fell away from the church (for almost 15 years).\nI felt even more distant from God, and sin increased in my life.\nA Renewed Faith\nIt was in 2020 when God started working in my heart.  The things in\nthis world seemed to be completely upside down ... pointing to an ever\nincreasing sinful nature of our society (just as predicted in the end\ntimes).\nGod laid on my heart that the difference between my past Christian\nLife and the Christians that were \"On Fire\" for the Lord, was the\nempowering of the Holy Spirit.  This world is complicated and it is\nnot something we can navigate on our own.  We need help.\nI believe there are two distinct aspects of the Holy Spirit in a\nbeliever's life:\n\nThe Indwelling of the Holy Spirit.  This happens at the moment of\nsalvation, and is a one-time occurrence.\n\nEmpowering of the Holy Spirit (or Baptism of the Spirit).  This is\nwhen the Holy Spirit comes upon a person in power.  \nThis is separate and distinct from salvation, and can occur multiple\ntimes in a believer's life.  There are examples in scripture where\none group of believers were empowered by the Holy Spirit multiple\ntimes.  This is something that was missing in my faith, and it is\ncrucial in providing the guidance to navigate life's every day\ntwists and turns (overcoming temptation and sin).\nHow does this happen, you might be wondering?  It's not difficult\nat all.

The opening narrative section presents six stories of\nhow God protected and promoted four young men who were taken into\nexile in Babylon. When Daniel and his friends Shadrach, Meshach and\nAbednego demonstrate their faithfulness to God, they are delivered\nfrom deadly perils by God’s mighty acts. Daniel was given the ability\nto interpret dreams, earning him a valued place in the royal court of\nBabylon, and later in the Persian Empire.\nThe second part of the book describes visions and messages Daniel\nreceived from God through angelic messengers. These visions are\npresented in the cryptic language and symbolic terms typical of\napocalyptic literature. Within them we see the outlines of Near\nEastern history: the empires of Babylon and Persia; the conquests of\nAlexander the Great; and the ongoing strife between the Ptolemys in\nEgypt and the Seleucids in Syria. The visions anticipate an arrogant\nruler, the Seleucid emperor Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who desecrated the\nJerusalem temple in 167 BC. This led to the Maccabean revolt, which\nrestored the nation’s independence and preserved the worship of\nIsrael’s God.\nThe visions in Daniel can also be understood to reveal the conditions\nat the end of the present age, showing it to be a time of definitive\nconflict between God’s people and their enemies. The people of God\nwill be sustained through their persecutions knowing they will receive\nthe kingdom.\n\nOverview Bible\n\nDaniel Introduction\nAs of 3/2022 Overview Bible has no Daniel video or diagram\n\nBible Project\n\nDaniel Introduction\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Daniel_BP', 'Daniel_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n2012 Daniel Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

A Roman\ncenturion’s declaration near the end of the book - Surely this man was\nthe Son of God! - models the witness to Jesus this gospel calls for.\nThe opening half of this fast-moving drama keys on the question: Who\ndo you say I am? An episode at the end of the first half shows Jesus\nhealing a blind man in two stages, so that he slowly comes to see. In\nthe same way the disciples have only gradually come to recognize who\nJesus is. Then in a key moment in the story, between its two halves,\nPeter confesses that Jesus is the Messiah.\nNow the conflict moves out into the open. Jesus has come to introduce\na radical new way of life that will undercut existing power\nrelationships. The second half of the drama depicts this in three\nacts:\n\nJesus and his disciples travel to Jerusalem.\n\nJesus teaches in the temple and clashes with the\nestablished leadership.\n\nIn the final act, that leadership executes its plan and has\nJesus arrested and crucified, seemingly overturning all he has\ndone. But then God overturns their deed and raises Jesus to\nlife. So Mark’s readers are called to be faithful to Jesus, even in\nsuffering, because this is how God continues to overturn the\nexisting order and establish the way of life that Jesus taught.\n\n\n\nOverview Bible\n\nMark Introduction\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Mark_OB', 'Mark_OB.png', 75);\n\n\n\nBible Project\n\nMark Introduction\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Mark_BP', 'Mark_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013-2014 Mark Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

In the first volume, the movement\nis toward Jerusalem, the center of Jewish national life. In the\nsecond, the movement is from Jerusalem to other nations, closing with\nPaul proclaiming the kingdom of God in Rome, the capital of the\nempire.\nLuke addresses his history to most excellent Theophilus,most likely a\nRoman official. His volumes are stocked with details from sources Luke\nhad available: letters, speeches, songs, travel accounts, trial\ntranscripts and biographical anecdotes. Luke’s purpose is to show the\nfulfillment of God’s plan to bring his light to the world through\nIsrael. The earliest Jesus-followers take up this calling by\nannouncing Jesus’ victory over sin and death to all the nations.\nThe first volume, Luke’s telling of the story of Jesus, has three main\nsections:\n\nJesus ministers in Galilee, the northern area of the land of\nIsrael.\n\nHe takes a long journey to Jerusalem, during which he welcomes\npeople into the way of God’s reign and challenges Israel’s current\nunderstanding of the kingdom.\n\nLuke tells how Jesus gives his life in Jerusalem and then rises\nfrom the dead to be revealed as Israel’s King and the world’s true\nLord.\n\n\n\nOverview Bible\n\nLuke Introduction\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Luke_OB', 'Luke-Acts_OB.png', 75);\n\n\n\nBible Project\n\nLuke Introduction\nPart 1: Luke 1-9 ...\nPart 2: Luke 10-24\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Luke_BP', 'Luke_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n2014-2015 Luke Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

God’s covenants with his human partners were\nimperfect, and humans failed to be faithful to the agreement. But\nJesus established a new covenant that is open to all people, Jew and\nGentile, creating a multiethnic family of God where self-giving love\nand forgiveness are at the center of everything.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2009 Romans Series\n2016 Romans Series\n2021 Romans Misc\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Romans Introduction\n\nAddressing the believers in Rome, Paul writes what is most likely the\nmeatiest missionary fundraising letter ever written. To\nJesus-followers living directly under the shadow of Caesar, he is\nappealing for help to bring the gospel to the western part of the\nempire. As an apostle, Paul has been set apart to make the royal\nannouncement about the Lordship of Jesus. God’s plan for the world has\nbeen revealed through a descendant of king David—Jesus the\nMessiah. This message demonstrates that God has been faithful to his\ncovenant with Israel.\nThe flow of the letter follows the pattern of the ancient Jewish story\nof slavery and rescue. Humanity is in exile due to the entrance of sin\nand death into the world. Even the Jewish law could not defeat death\nand bring life. But God has come to rescue both Jews and Gentiles\nthrough the death and resurrection of Jesus. A new worldwide family is\nbeing created. Baptism into Jesus breaks the power of evil and brings\nfreedom. The Holy Spirit leads the way into this new life that will be\ncomplete in a new inheritance—a redeemed creation.\nAlthough many in Israel had failed to believe in the Messiah, this\nended up bringing life to the rest of the world. The offer of life\nthrough Jesus remains for all, however, and in the end God’s mercy\nwill triumph over judgment. The closing emphasis is on the practical\nshape of a redeemed humanity’s new way of life.\n\nBible Project\n\nRomans Introduction\nPart 1: Romans 1-4 ...\nPart 2: Romans 5-16\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Romans_BP', 'Romans_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n2009 Romans Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

He visited the city of\nCorinth there, a wealthy and cosmopolitan commercial center. Many\npeople became believers, so he stayed for a year and a half to teach\nthem.\nAfter he left, the Corinthians wrote to Paul (in a letter we no longer\nhave) with some key questions. The Corinthians had adopted the common\nGreek idea that physical things are bad, so they wanted to free the\nhuman spirit from the body. This affected the way they saw such things\nas marriage, attendance at ceremonial meals for pagan gods, and even\nthe resurrection of Jesus. In the letter we know as 1 Corinthians Paul\naddresses all of these concerns, as well as questions about worship.\nPaul writes that this world in its present form is passing away,but\nthe Corinthians can give themselves fully to the work of the Lord\nsince their labor in the Lord is not in vain. The coming resurrection\nof the dead, and the new world that will accompany it, will show the\nvalue of all their current efforts. Paul’s practical advice for how to\nconsistently embody the new life of God’s kingdom during a particular\nscene in the biblical drama gives us great insight as we seek to take\nup our roles today.\n\nOverview Bible\n\n1 Corinthians Introduction\nAs of 3/2022 Overview Bible has no 1 Corinthians video or diagram\n\nBible Project\n\n1 Corinthians Introduction\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('1Corinthians_BP', '1Corinthians_BP.png', 75);\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n2009 1 Corinthians Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

The letter we know as 2 Corinthians\nfurther reveals the triumphs and struggles that result when life in\nthe present age meets up with the in-breaking reality of God’s\nkingdom. Here we see Paul working to repair relationships, explain\nvarious changes in travel plans, make practical arrangements for\ncollecting a gift for the struggling believers in Jerusalem, and\ndirectly confront challenges to his own leadership by the\nself-proclaimed “super-apostles.”\nIn the four main parts of the letter, each introduced by a reference\nto a place, Paul envisions himself in different locations, recalling\nor anticipating his relationship with the Corinthians. The single\ntheme running through these sections is that God will comfort us in\nall our troubles, and we will offer this comfort to each other. This\nmodels the life of Jesus himself, who suffered first and then was\ncomforted.

Paul traveled here\non each of the three journeys he made to spread the message about\nJesus. The Galatians received both Paul and his gospel announcement\nwarmly. But later some people Paul calls agitators came and challenged\nPaul’s leadership as well as the foundation of his teaching. So Paul\nwrote to answer the threat to his status as an apostle and to reaffirm\nthe core message that faith in the Messiah is the basis of membership\nin God’s new community.\nPaul doesn’t open his letter by appealing to the apostles in\nJerusalem. Instead, he insists that the gospel I preached is not of\nhuman origin … rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus\nChrist.  Paul is compelled to share this revelation, and he notes that\nthe other apostles support him.\nPaul then proceeds to his main argument, which is that Gentiles who\nhave become followers of Jesus do not need to be circumcised. The new\nworldwide family which had been promised to Abraham is created by\nfaith in Messiah Jesus, not by keeping the Jewish law (Torah). The\nbiblical story had been pointing to this all along.\nBut if following Torah is not the basis of the gospel, won’t there be\nanarchy? Paul answers by describing what Spirit-empowered life looks\nlike in the community of Messiah-followers. Paul closes by emphasizing\nthe main theme of his letter once more: Neither circumcision nor\nuncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation.\n\nBible Project\n\nGalatians Introduction\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Galatians_BP', 'Galatians_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n2010 Galatians Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

Many people became believers,\nbut there was a riot when Paul and Silas were accused of defying\nCaesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus\n(see Acts 17:1-9). They narrowly escaped with their lives and had to\nflee.\nA little later Paul became concerned that the believers in\nThessalonica might fall away from the faith due to the opposition they\nwere facing. So he sent Timothy to encourage them (as a Greek he could\nmake the trip more safely). When Timothy returned to Achaia with the\nwelcome news that the Thessalonians had remained faithful, Paul wrote\nto express his joy.\nIn this short letter, Paul first recalls his time in Thessalonica and\ngives thanks for their continuing faith, despite trials and\nchallenges. He teaches them to avoid sexual immorality, to love one\nanother sincerely, and to work hard to earn their own living.\nPaul then addresses a key pastoral question: What is the Christian\nhope for those who have died? He explains that believers who die\nbefore the royal appearance of the Messiah are not lost, but will\nsurely be raised from the dead when he comes. He reminds the\nThessalonians that Jesus will appear suddenly and unexpectedly. They\nshould therefore live in such a way that they would be unashamed to\ngreet him. Throughout the letter Paul’s basic message is, “Keep up the\ngood work!”\n\nOverview Bible\n\n1 Thessalonians Introduction\nAs of 3/2022 Overview Bible has no 1 Thessalonians video or diagram\n\nBible Project\n\n1 Thessalonians Introduction\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('1Thessalonians_BP', '1Thessalonians_BP.png', 75);\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n2010 1 Thessalonians Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\nNOTE: This series covers both First and Second Thessalonians\n\n\n\n\n\n  1.

The day of the\nLord was a phrase from the Hebrew prophets to describe God’s key\nvictory over every opponent, when his faithful ones would be\nrewarded. The Thessalonians’ concern seems to have been not that the\nday had come and gone and they had missed it, but that it was now\npresent. That would mean nothing more was to be expected from God in\nterms of setting things right. Since they continued to suffer\npersecutions, this was a depressing prospect.\nEven before he contradicts this false report, Paul reassures the\nThessalonians that God will indeed pay back all those who were\ntroubling them. He reminds them of the details he had discussed with\nthem in person of how the day of the Lord would arrive. He then\nrepeats some instruction from his earlier letter, urging them not to\nbe idle but to work hard and earn their own livings.\nAt the end of the letter, most of which would have been written by a\nscribe, Paul adds a greeting in his own handwriting.

While in exile on the island of Patmos, a Jewish Christian\nprophet named John received a vision showing that the cult of emperor\nworship would soon become deadly to followers of the Messiah. The book\nof Revelation (or Apocalypse, meaning unveiling) is a warning,\ncirculated to seven cities in the Roman province of Asia Minor. John’s\nmain point is to challenge and encourage the believers in the midst of\ntheir opposition and persecution.\nRevelation is an apocalypse, a literary form well known in John’s\nday. In an apocalypse a visitor from heaven reveals the secrets of the\nunseen world and the future through vivid symbols. While the symbols\nmay appear strange at first, they become more clear when seen in their\nfirst-century setting and in light of other Bible imagery.\nJohn’s vision has four main parts, each marked by the phrase in the\nSpirit. After words of warning and encouragement to each of the seven\nchurches, John’s visions then center on Jesus—his role in redemption\nand the judgments he brings to the world. The immoral political and\neconomic forces that rebel against God will be destroyed, and the\nMessiah will triumph over all his enemies. The vision closes with the\npromise that God’s faithful servants will reign over the new creation.\nRevelation also functions as the appropriate conclusion to the entire\ndrama of the Bible. John concludes with images from the garden of\nEden, the first story in the Bible. The world will experience a fresh\nbeginning: He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making\neverything new!”\n\nOverview Bible\n\nRevelation Introduction\nAs of 3/2022 Overview Bible has no Revelation video or diagram\n\nBible Project\n\nRevelation Introduction\nPart 1: Rev 1-11 ...\nPart 2: Rev 12-22\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Revelation_BP', 'Revelation_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\nAs of 3/2022 Spoken Gospel has no Revelation entry\n\n2011 Revelation Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

Ephesians 2:10 - Created! Designed! Empowered!\nESV\n\n  so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.\n  -->\n  For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,\n  not a result of works, so that no one may boast.\n  For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.\n\n\nMSG\n\n  Now God has us where he wants us, with all the time in this world and the next to shower grace and kindness upon us in Christ Jesus.\n  -->\n  Saving is all his idea, and all his work. All we do is trust him enough to let him do it.\n  It’s God’s gift from start to finish! We don’t play the major role. If we did, we’d probably go around bragging that we’d done the whole thing! No, we neither make nor save ourselves. God does both the making and saving.\n  He creates each of us by Christ Jesus to join him in the work he does, the good work he has gotten ready for us to do, work we had better be doing.\n\n\nDiscuss\n\nwe have all been memorizing our scripture verse\nAnd you guys have been doing a great job!\nMy question to you is have you thought about what it this verse means?\n\n\nlet's back up to the previous verse - vs. 8-9\nthis is a very famous verse in the Bible, where God reveals how we can be saved\ncontrast/read ESV/MSG\n\n\nso now we look again at our memory verse - vs. 10\nwe are God's workmanship (Greek: poiema - work of art) - a new thing NOT refurbishment - a whole new thing\nto do good works\nSKIP wait a minute, I thought the prior verse said that salvation is not through our works?\nwhat does this mean?\ndo you think we can do enough good works to be saved?\n\n\nthe works in this verse is talking \nNOT about something that saves us\nBUT rather it is something that shows that we are saved!\nWHEN we ask Jesus to come in our life, he changes us so that we want to do his work\nAND that can be a whole different set of things\nlike helping out a friend\nor being kind to someone\nbut it always means we are anxious to share the good news of how God saved us\n... because that's how other people can find out how they can be saved\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlet's say our memory verse together\n\nSchedule\n\n\n      5:45-6:10 (25 mins)   C204                     Opening Activities                         \n   6:15-6:40 (25 mins)   A Gym (FBM/Elementary)   Worship Rally                              \n     6:40-7:10 (30 mins)   FBM Chapel               Bible Study #1                             \n     7:10-7:20 (20 mins)   Middle School Cafeteria  Snack                                      \n      7:20-7:40 (20 mins)   E Gym #1 (H.S)           Recreation                                 \n  7:40-8:00 (20 mins)   C225 (Preteen Area)      Missions #2                                \n    8:00-8:20 (20 mins)   C204                     Crafts                                     \n     8:20-8:30 (10 mins)   C204                     Closing Group Time / Review and Dismissal  \n\n\n\nSchedule (Friday)\n\n\n      5:45-6:10 (25 mins)   C204                      Opening Activities                         \n     6:10-6:35 (25 mins)   FBM Chapel                Bible Study #1                             \n     6:35-6:45 (10 mins)   Middle School Cafeteria   Snack                                      \n      6:45-7:05 (20 mins)   E Gym #1 (H.S)            Recreation                                 \n  7:05-7:25 (20 mins)   C225 (Preteen Area)       Missions #2                                \n    7:25-7:45 (20 mins)   C204                      Crafts                                     \n   7:45-8:10 (25 mins)   A Gym (FBM/Elementary)    Worship Rally                              \n     8:20-8:30 (10 mins)   C204                      Closing Group Time / Review and Dismissal  \n\n\n\n\nMaps\n\n  \n    \n    BASE: Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('VBS_map1', 'VBS_map1.png', 75);\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    FIRST: Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('VBS_map2', 'VBS_map2.png', 75);\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    RECK: Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('VBS_map3', 'VBS_map3.png', 75);\n\n\n\n\n\n  // explicitly invoke our page setup here\n  // - believe this is executed after all DOM elms (above) are up-and-running)\n  // - was having difficulty with following:\n  //      window.addEventListener('load', pageSetup());\n  //      * it was in fact executed EACH time the page is loaded\n  //      * HOWEVER the 'onload' event fired ONLY ONCE (not in navigating to other page and back)\n  //        - this must have something to do with how GITBOOK does it's navigation\n  //          ... not really sure\n\n  // handles BOTH registerImgClickFullScreenHandlers() & initializeCompletedChecks()\n  pageSetup();\n\n"}}}
