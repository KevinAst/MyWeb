Within\n \nWelcome to my \"Fire Within\" Bible Study Guide!\nYou may have guessed that I am a believer and follower of Jesus Christ\n(i.e. a Christian).  The short version of my faith is I accepted\nChrist at an early age, and was active in my Church for many years.\nHowever I felt something lacking in my faith.  I actually fell away\nfrom God much later in life, and through a series of (what I believe\nwere miraculous events), God called me back into His fold.  Through\nthe empowerment of the Holy Spirit, I now have a passion to be in His\nword daily, allowing it to guide my life and decisions.\nI share more about my Christian faith in the My Faith section.\nTechnology\nTechnology has radically changed the vast amount of resources that are\ninstantly available to us all ... even as believers!\nYou can install the You Version Bible App\n(on your phone) which contains the entire Bible (any version)\n... held right in the palm of your hand!  From this you can read\nthe scriptures, or stream an audible reading of God's word during your\ncommute or work-out.\nIn addition you can find an abundance of Bible study resources on the\ninternet.  The problem is they are somewhat disjointed\nand difficult to organize and keep track of (in the context of a\nBible study).\nAs a result I created this site.  It is merely an accumulation of\nresource links that guide me through the books of the Bible.  Because\nthey are concisely organized, it helps in keeping track of where you\nare in your study.\nHow I Study\nEveryone is going to have their own preference on how they study the\nBible.  In my case, I have found that it helps me to supplement the\nreading of Gods word with a sermon series from a trusted evangelical\npastor.  It simply adds more background and insight that makes the\nscriptures come alive.  This of course this is in addition to\nprayer - asking the Holy Spirit for discernment and\nguidance.\nWhen I study a book of the Bible, I follow this pattern:\n\nI like a high-level orientation to the book.  What is the\nbackground?  Who are the main characters.  Why was the book\nwritten and what is it's major theme and emphasis?\n\nIn some cases, I may audibly stream the entire book at a time.\nI am a slow reader, so streaming is a good option for me.\n\nFor the actual study, I will read (or audibly stream) a few\nchapters at a time.\n\nI then supplement what I have read with the sermon series that I\nmentioned above.\n\nRepeat steps 3 and 4 through the completion of the book :-)\n\n\nResources\nRegarding the trusted set of resources found on this site, I am\npromoting the following:\n\nFor the high-level orientation of each book, I offer two resources:\nBible Project, and Spoken Gospel.  You are free to\nuse both of these, or simply choose the one that you prefer.  The\nfirst is a presentation style, where the second is more of a\ncontemporary video series.\n\nRegarding the main resource containing the sermon series on each\nbook, I am using Cornerstone Chapel (with Pastor Gary\nHamrick).  This is a non denominational evangelical church in\nLeesburg, VA. I have grown to love the ministry of Pastor Gary.  He\nprovides so much insight to the scriptures, making them simply come\nalive (somewhat akin to watching The\nChosen series on the\nlife of Christ ).\n\n\nI am so grateful for these biblical resources, and the men and women\nof God that have made them possible.\n\nPlease note that this Bible Study Guide is not yet complete.  To\nrequest a specific book to be added, please see the\nWork In Progress section.\n\nGod Bless You\nI pray that you find these resources useful in your personal Bible\nStudy.

Whether we accept the truth or not, it is still the truth,\n                and it will be the truth at the end of our lives when we stand before\n                a holy God. The only way to escape the wrath of God and live in peace\n                and joy with him forever is to believe that the blood of Christ is the\n                only thing that can take away our sins.\n -->\nWhy does this matter?\nBefore we get started, I have a question.  It is a rather sobering\none, but something that is very important to consider:\n\nIf you should die this very moment, do you know what your fate would be?\n\nThe bible tells us that the rightful punishment for sin (our natural\nstate) is death and eternal separation from God.  This represents an\nan eternity in hell (Romans 6:23, \nJohn 5:29, \nRevelation 21:6-8).\nThe reason this question is so important is that it determines how we\nwill live out eternity.  Whether we accept the truth or not, it is\nstill the truth, and it will be the truth at the end of our lives when\nwe stand before a Holy God.\nWhat does it mean to be a Christian?\nI suspect that many people have a misconception of what it means to be\na Christian.  They look at it as a process of \"pulling yourself up by\nyour bootstraps\" ... to live a good enough life to be accepted into\nHeaven by God.  \nI can appreciate this concept because this is what all other religions\nstrive for.\nThe truth of the matter is nothing could be further from the truth.\nIt is not possible for us to work our way into heaven with our \"good\ndeeds\".  \nWhile we should certainly strive to do good, it should be done from a\ndifferent motivation.  Good works flow from salvation, not the other\nway around.  More importantly it doesn't change our status with God.\nWe simply cannot overcome His holiness gap (it is too great a\nchasm).\nThe Bible reveals that no amount of works (goodness, morality, or\nreligious activity) can gain us acceptance with God.  The moral and\nreligious are in the same boat as the immoral and non-religious.  We\nall fall short of God's perfect righteousness.\n\nThe Apostle Paul declares that all people are under sin,\nand that \"there is no one righteous, not even one\"\n(Romans 3:9-10 referencing\nPsalms 14:3,\nPsalms 53:1-3, and\nEcclesiastes 7:20).\n\nThe Profit Isaiah proclaims that our righteousness is like \"filthy rags\"\nbefore God (Isaiah 64:6).\n\n\nSo what does this mean?  Is our quest to have a relationship with God in vain?\nMore on this in just a bit ...\nGod is Holy\nIn reality, there is a deep chasm between us and the Holy God.  It is\ndifficult to even comprehend how Holy our God is.  What separates us\nfrom God is our sinful nature, and there is nothing we can do in and\nof ourselves to bridge that gap.\nIn the Beginning\nIt wasn't always this way.  When God created the world, we had a pure\nrelationship with Him (in Adam and Eve).  They regularly communed\nwith God in the garden and exerienced sheer happiness and joy.\nBut God gave us free will, and Adam and Eve chose to disobey God\n(and so by inference - us).  Hence ushered in the severing of our\nrelationship with God.\nFrom that very moment in time, God formulated a plan to bring us back\ninto His fold.\nAm I good enough?\nYou might be saying, well I'm a pretty good person ... I look out for\nothers ... I'm not a cheat or a thief ... etc.  Those are all good\nthings, but it doesn't come close to the standard of a Holy God.\n\nJesus reveals that even our thoughts can be sinful\n(Matthew 5:28)\n\nJames tells us that it is our desires that give birth to sinful action\n(James 1:14-15)\n\n\nThe Gospel\nThe Gospel is the Good News that salvation is God's free gift to us.\nBut we must accept it\n(John 14:6\nRomans 10:9-10).\nGod requires a sacrifice for the atonement of our sins.  This is what\nthe Old Testament sacrificial system was (a temporary one, which had\nto be repeated).  In reality, this was simply a picture (or a\nforetelling) of the ultimate sacrifice (a permanent one) ... that is\nof Jesus Christ.  Jesus (who is part of the triune God head - Father,\nSon, and Holy Ghost), who always existed, humbled himself and came to\nearth through a miraculous virgin birth.  He is both God and man.  He\nlived a sinless perfect life.  His ministry modeled the true\nrelationship we can have with God.  He was sacrificed on a cross (the\nmost brutal and shameful death imaginable), as a permanent atonement\nfor our sins.  He rose from the dead (the first of many saints), and\nascended into heaven, where he prepares a place for his followers.\nThe bible tells us that:\n\nAll have sinned\n(Romans 3:10\nRomans 3:23)\n\nThe results of sin is death ... but we don't have to experience\ndeath and hell, for God's gift to us is forgiveness and eternal life\nin heaven with Him\n(Romans 6:23\nJohn 3:16-18)\n\nIn order to receive this gift, you must believe that it is real and\nthat it can truly change your life. This is more than a simple\n\"head knowledge\".  It is an act of trusting Jesus with your heart,\nand turning your life over to Him\n(Ephesians 2:8).\nYou must confess Jesus as Lord\n(Romans 10:13).\n\n\nSalvation is a free gift of God, offered to all who simply ask.\nIf you want to become a Christian, you must fervently\nbelieve in the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus, repent from your\nsin, and ask him to come into and change your life.  You can\nsimply pray this prayer:\n\nLord Jesus, I confess that I have sinned.\nI repent of my sin and turn to you.\nI believe that you died on the cross for me.\nThat you rose from the dead.\nThat you reign in heaven.\nI confess you as my Lord, and my Savior.\nI pledge my life to you from this day forward.\nFill me with your spirit, that I might be your servant.\nThank you for saving me.\nIn Jesus name.\nAmen\n\nThe truth of the matter is Christianity is less about religion, and\nmore about a personal relationship with God.\nIf you prayed this prayer, there are angels rejoicing in heaven\n(Luke 15:10)!  This reveals\njust how valuable you are to God and how much He desires for you to be\nwith Him in heaven forever!  A great victory has been won!  Your next\nstep is to seek out other believers, in a local Bible believing\nchurch, that can assist and disciple you in your new found faith!\nMy Faith\nIn my personal life, I made this profession of faith as a young boy,\nduring a revival of my parents church.\nI was active in my church, trying to live a life that honored God.  I\ncontinued that process into my adult days, raising my family and\ncontinuing to be active in my church.\nHowever, it seemed like I was missing something.  I would see other\nChristians that were \"on fire\" for the Lord.  I didn't have the\npassion to be in God's Word, and my prayer life was non-existent.  It\nseemed like I was merely going through the motions.\nIn 2005 I actually fell away from the church (for almost 15 years).\nI felt even more distant from God, and sin increased in my life.\nA Renewed Faith\nIt was in 2020 when God started working in my heart.  The things in\nthis world seemed to be completely upside down ... pointing to an ever\nincreasing sinful nature of our society (just as predicted in the end\ntimes).\nGod laid on my heart that the difference between my past Christian\nLife and the Christians that were \"On Fire\" for the Lord, was the\nempowering of the Holy Spirit.  This world is complicated and it is\nnot something we can navigate on our own.  We need help.\nI believe there are two distinct aspects of the Holy Spirit in a\nbeliever's life:\n\nThe Indwelling of the Holy Spirit.  This happens at the moment of\nsalvation, and is a one-time occurrence.\n\nEmpowering of the Holy Spirit (or Baptism of the Spirit).  This is\nwhen the Holy Spirit comes upon a person in power.  \nThis is separate and distinct from salvation, and can occur multiple\ntimes in a believer's life.  There are examples in scripture where\none group of believers were empowered by the Holy Spirit multiple\ntimes.  This is something that was missing in my faith, and it is\ncrucial in providing the guidance to navigate life's every day\ntwists and turns (overcoming temptation and sin).\nHow does this happen, you might be wondering?  It's not difficult\nat all.  It happens by simply asking God, and believing by faith.\n\n\n\nFor a full explanation of this concept, please listen to\nPastor Gary Hamrick's Sermon in Acts 2:1-13.\n\nWhen I fervently asked the Holy Spirit to empower me and assist me in\nmy daily life, it was truly a miracle.\n\nThe past sins in my life were greatly diminished.  This was not an\ninsignificant thing ... my desire for long standing addictions were\nsimply removed ... Praise God!\n\nFor the first time I had a passion to be in God's word, soaking up\neverything He has for me through his word.  This has manifest itself\nin this Bible Study blog.\n\nMy prayer life is improving, but still needs work (please pray for\nme in this regard).\n\nI have for the first time, a desire to share my faith with others.\nIf you think about it, this is the most crucial aspect of a\nChristian's life, and part of the Lord Jesus' Great Commission\n(Matthew 28:16-20)\n... sharing the Good News to a lost world.\n\n\nI'm certainly not perfect.  I have and will have a long way to go in\nsolidifying my relationship with God.  But this is certainly a step in\nthe right direction, and I thank God for his provision!\nMay the Lord Bless You\nI pray that if you do not know the Lord, you will consider what has\nbeen presented here, and ask him to come into your life.\nIf you do know the Lord, I pray that God will bless you in your walk\nwith Christ.\nYours In Christ,\n\n\n\n  addInquire('Fire%20Within%20Feedback');\n\n"},"OldTestament.html":{"url":"OldTestament.html","title":"Old Testament","keywords":"","body":"Old Testament\nThe Old Testament includes 39 books which were written long before Jesus was born.\n\n\n\n\nThe Old Testament books are divided into five groups \n(find out more):\n\nTorah (Law of Moses):\nGenesis\nExodus\nLeviticus\nNumbers\nDeuteronomy\n\n\nHistorical Writings:\nJoshua*\nJudges*\nRuth*\n1 Samuel*\n2 Samuel*\n1 Kings*\n2 Kings*\n1 Chronicles*\n2 Chronicles*\nEzra*\nNehemiah*\nEsther*\n\n\nWisdom and Poetry:\nJob*\nPsalms*\nProverbs*\nEcclesiastes*\nSong of Solomon*\n\n\nMajor Prophets:\nIsaiah*\nJeremiah*\nLamentations*\nEzekiel*\nDaniel\n\n\nMinor Prophets:\nHosea\nJoel*\nAmos\nObadiah*\nJonah\nMicah\nNahum*\nHabakkuk*\nZephaniah*\nHaggai*\nZechariah*\nMalachi*\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that this Bible Study Guide is not yet complete (asteric indicates ToDo).\nTo request a specific book to be added, please see the Work In Progress section.\n\n"},"Genesis.html":{"url":"Genesis.html","title":"Genesis","keywords":"","body":"Genesis\n\n\nIn the first part of Genesis (1-11), we see that God creates a good\nworld and commissions humans to rule it, but they choose rebellion\nagain and again.

Genesis is traditionally attributed to\nMoses, the one who led the people of Israel out of Egypt.\nGenesis explains how one nation comes to have a special role in God’s\nplan for all of humanity. Early on, the order and harmony of God’s\ngood creation are overwhelmed by the destructive consequences of human\nrebellion and pride. The violence, injustice and suffering that follow\nlead God to condemn and restrain human wickedness through the judgment\nof the great flood. God then makes a covenant with Abraham and his\ndescendants, providing an ongoing framework for the story. The family\nof Abraham—Israel—will be God’s chosen means to bring the nations back\nto himself. Genesis closes with Abraham’s descendants having grown\ninto a league of large tribes, but they are not in the land God has\npromised them. So the story leads naturally into the books that\nfollow.\nThe book is divided into twelve parts by eleven repetitions of the\nphrase this is the account of. Each section is about the life and\nfamily of the person named. These are woven together to document the\nstory of human history and the beginning of God’s plan to restore\nhumanity and their place in his world through Israel.\n\nBible Project\n\nGenesis Introduction\nPart 1: Genesis 1-11 ...\nPart 2: Genesis 12-50\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Genesis_BP', 'Genesis_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n2011 Genesis Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n   1.

Exodus is where we\nfind the stories of the Ten Plagues, the first Passover, the parting\nof the Red Sea, and the Ten Commandments.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\nThe Ten Commandments\nExodus Series\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Exodus Introduction\n\nThe books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers continue the story of how\nGod formed the nation of Israel to play a special role in his plans\nfor the whole world. When the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, God\ncame to them and worked powerfully through Moses to deliver them. At\nMount Sinai, God revealed his laws to Moses, including the Ten\nCommandments, and confirmed his covenant with the young nation. Israel\nbuilt a “tabernacle,” or “tent of meeting,” so that God could live\namong them. The people then traveled through the wilderness to the\nland of Canaan.\nThe boundaries between the books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers are\nnot sharply drawn. The key structure throughout the books relates to\nthe various places the Israelites stopped on their journey. Each\nlocation is noted, and the events at each one are described. The key\nlocation is Mount Sinai; the second half of Exodus, all of Leviticus,\nand the beginning of Numbers describe what took place there. Leviticus\nspecifically contains the laws and regulations the Lord gave to\nIsrael. Numbers reports how the people were organized into a fighting\nforce and moved toward the promised land.\nNumbers reaches back across Leviticus and Exodus and repeats the\nphrase that structures Genesis: This is the account of the family of\nAaron and Moses (Num. 3:1). Appropriately, we hear this phrase for the\ntwelfth time as the twelve tribes are being organized into a\nnation. Near the end of Numbers the prophet Balaam says to Israel, May\nthose who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed.

Before\nthey do, Moses rallies the people to remind them of God’s law—and why\nthey should obey Him. This is how the book of Deuteronomy gets its\nname: it’s the “second giving” of God’s law.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2013 Deuteronomy Series\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Deuteronomy Introduction\n\nThe book of Deuteronomy records the great speech Moses gives just\nbefore his death. He addresses the generation of Israelites who grew\nup in the wilderness just as they are preparing to enter the land of\nCanaan. God wants this promised land to show what renewed life under\nGod’s blessing looks like. The book presents the covenant in a form\ncommonly used by rulers of the time to make treaties with those they\nruled over. The standard form of these treaties included five\nelements:\n\nThe great ruler is identified by name and title.\nThe history and mighty acts of the great ruler are told.\nThe allegiance and specific duties expected of the ruler’s servants are spelled out.\nBlessings for keeping the treaty and curses for breaking it are listed.\nProvisions for continuing the covenant with future generations are laid out.\n\nDeuteronomy follows this pattern very closely. Moses is identified as\nthe representative of the Great King—the God of Israel—whose mighty\nacts for his people are recalled. Moses reminds them to give exclusive\nallegiance to their king and lists their duties. He then calls on the\npeople to join in a sacred oath to ratify the covenant. After naming a\nsuccessor and climbing a mountain to look out over the land, Moses\ndies. The people of Israel stand on the edge of their inheritance, the\npromise of a new creation before them.\n\nBible Project\n\nDeuteronomy Introduction\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Deuteronomy_BP', 'Deuteronomy_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n2013 Deuteronomy Series\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

And yes ... there’s a famous story about a lion’s den.\nIsaiah was right. Jeremiah was right. Habakkuk was right. The\nBabylonians had attacked Jerusalem and carried off many Jewish\ncaptives. One of them was a young man named Daniel.\nWhat does it look like to be faithful in the midst of exile? The book\nof Daniel offers a surprising and relevant answer.

The opening narrative section presents six stories of\nhow God protected and promoted four young men who were taken into\nexile in Babylon. When Daniel and his friends Shadrach, Meshach and\nAbednego demonstrate their faithfulness to God, they are delivered\nfrom deadly perils by God’s mighty acts. Daniel was given the ability\nto interpret dreams, earning him a valued place in the royal court of\nBabylon, and later in the Persian Empire.\nThe second part of the book describes visions and messages Daniel\nreceived from God through angelic messengers. These visions are\npresented in the cryptic language and symbolic terms typical of\napocalyptic literature. Within them we see the outlines of Near\nEastern history: the empires of Babylon and Persia; the conquests of\nAlexander the Great; and the ongoing strife between the Ptolemys in\nEgypt and the Seleucids in Syria. The visions anticipate an arrogant\nruler, the Seleucid emperor Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who desecrated the\nJerusalem temple in 167 BC. This led to the Maccabean revolt, which\nrestored the nation’s independence and preserved the worship of\nIsrael’s God.\nThe visions in Daniel can also be understood to reveal the conditions\nat the end of the present age, showing it to be a time of definitive\nconflict between God’s people and their enemies. The people of God\nwill be sustained through their persecutions knowing they will receive\nthe kingdom.\n\nBible Project\n\nDaniel Introduction\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Daniel_BP', 'Daniel_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n2012 Daniel Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

King Jeroboam II, one of the worst kings in Israel's\nhistory, grew apathetic and allowed idol worship in the nation,\nopening the doorway for Israelites to cheat, steal, have unlawful sex,\nand even murder each other. Growing cold and distant, they had\nforgotten about God’s unending love for them, ushering in tragic\nconsequences.\nBut God does not forget Israel even in their self-destruction. There\nis still hope. God will send a Messiah to restore Israel to covenant\nfaithfulness and relationship with him.\nGod Is Forever Faithful\nIn the book of Hosea, God sends Hosea to Israel during the reign of\nKing Jeroboam II to communicate God’s despair over their perpetual\nidol worship and dependence on outside nations. Though the people have\nfailed to be faithful covenant partners to God, his commitment to them\nremains.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\nHosea Series\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Hosea Introduction\n\nThe prophet Hosea spoke to the northern kingdom of Israel in the\nturbulent period of the 8th century BC. Following the death of Jeroboam\nII, Israel had six different kings in just over twenty years; four\nwere assassinated and the last was forcibly removed from the\nthrone. The rising empire of Assyria invaded Israel, and by 722 BC had\ncompletely conquered the nation and carried off much of its population\ninto exile.\nIsrael had made the mistake of identifying the Lord with Baal, a\nCanaanite nature god. This identification may have begun innocently\nenough, since baal simply means “master.” But by the time of Hosea, the\npeople were visiting shrine prostitutes, and had adopted the magical\npractices of fertility cults. Hosea repeatedly denounces this\ncorrupted worship as spiritual prostitution. He also condemns the\nnation’s foolish foreign intrigues, its rejection of the moral law,\nand its callous greed. The people dismissed Hosea’s warnings, however,\nand simply mocked him.\nThe book is structured into two main parts. The shorter first part\ntells how God commanded Hosea to marry the unfaithful woman Gomer. She\nis symbolic of Israel’s wavering faithfulness to the Lord. The\nprophet’s own life thus provided a picture of God’s intentions toward\nwayward Israel. The longer second part contains oracles delivered\nduring the decline after King Jeroboam, alternating hope and doom as\nHosea both threatens and pleads with the kingdom of Israel in the last\nyears before its exile.\n\nBible Project\n\nHosea Introduction\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Hosea_BP', 'Hosea_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nHosea Series\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

Confident in their\nnation’s victories, their worship, and their heritage, the people\nadopted the motto, “God is with us!” They were anticipating the day of\nthe Lord, when God would strike down all their enemies and establish\nIsrael as the undisputed ruler of the region.\nInto this atmosphere of overconfident nationalism steps Amos, a\nshepherd from the southern kingdom of Judah. He stands in the great\nroyal temple at Bethel and announces that God is stirring up a nation\nto conquer Israel. The day of the Lord, he insisted, will be darkness,\nnot light. God isn’t impressed with Israel’s wealth, military might,\nor self-indulgent way of life. He is looking for justice, while the\nrich and powerful are taking advantage of the poor. God is calling\nIsrael to repentance as the only way to avoid destruction.\nThe message causes an uproar. Amaziah, the high priest at Bethel,\naccuses Amos of treason. Amos is banished from the kingdom, but his\noracles are recorded, creating one of the earliest collections we have\nfrom any Hebrew prophet. The book consists of roughly three dozen\nseparate oracles, plus the story of his expulsion. Most of the book is\nloosely assembled, but it conveys one strong and consistent message:\nLet justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing\nstream!\n\nBible Project\n\nAmos Introduction\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Amos_BP', 'Amos_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAmos Series\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

He runs from his calling at every turn, showing\nlittle faith in Yahweh. But eventually he goes to the nation of\nNineveh to deliver God’s message. This is where things start to get\nconfusing.\nDespite Jonah’s warning having the intended effect—Nineveh turning in\nrepentance to Yahweh—Jonah is furious with God for sparing the\nNinevites. What is going on in this story? There’s a lot to unpack,\nand it’s probably a lot different than what you learned in Sunday\nschool.\nWhat can we learn from Jonah?\nThe story of Joanh recounts remarkable experiences with storms at sea,\nbeing eaten by a fish, and plants that miraculously grow and die in a\nday, and the lessons behind these images go much deeper than what is\non the surface.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\nJonah Series\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Jonah Introduction\n\nThe book relates how the word of the Lord came to Jonah, a prophet\nduring the reign of Jeroboam II in the 8th century BC. It is unique\namong prophetic books in focusing on a story about a prophet rather\nthan a collection of oracles. The book contains only a single sentence\nof prophecy.\nThe story concerns God’s call to Jonah to warn the people of Nineveh\nof its coming destruction. The book is structured into two main acts\nwith two scenes each. The repetition of God’s command to Go to the\ngreat city of Nineveh marks the beginning of each act. The first scene\nis set on a ship as Jonah tries to avoid his mission. The second scene\ntakes place in the belly of a huge fish which has swallowed Jonah. In\nthe second act both scenes are associated with Nineveh itself, the\nfirst within the city as Jonah preaches and Nineveh repents, the\nsecond just outside the city as Jonah struggles with God’s mercy.\nJonah’s role in the book is to represent the attitude of many in\nIsrael toward other nations. Instead of accepting their own calling to\nhelp these nations come to know the true God, they considered them\nenemies and expected God to destroy them. The book teaches that God’s\nlove extends beyond Israel to other nations, indeed, to the whole\ncreation.

But Micah’s\nprophecies are not without hope. The God of Israel is also faithful\nand full of mercy. God promises to preserve a faithful remnant, from\nwhich he will create a new Jerusalem on the other side of sin and\nexile.\nThe Good Shepherd\nThe book of Micah paints a picture of a just yet merciful God. Like a\nshepherd, God will one day gather and restore a faithful remnant to\nthe land. He will rebuild Jerusalem, defeat evil forever, and send a\nmessianic King to rule over the people and bless all the nations.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\nMicah Series\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Micah Introduction\n\nThe prophet Micah speaks to the southern kingdom of Judah during the\nreigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah (late 8th century BC). He foresees\nthat Samaria and Jerusalem, the capital cities of Israel and Judah,\nwill be destroyed because of their injustice and corrupt religion. The\npeople have abandoned the covenant God made with them, taking up the\npagan religious practices of the Canaanites. The rich and powerful are\nruthlessly exploiting the poor, ignoring the law of Moses. Micah warns\nthat in punishment for their unfaithfulness and injustice, both\nkingdoms will be invaded, conquered and exiled. As he predicts,\nSamaria falls to the Assyrians in 722 BC and Jerusalem falls to the\nBabylonians in 587/6 BC.\nMicah’s prophecies alternate between warnings of destruction and\npromises of restoration. Each of Micah’s three groups of oracles\nbegins with a series of judgments, and then concludes with promises of\nrestoration. Micah proclaims that in compassion and covenant\nfaithfulness God will save a remnant of the people and bring them back\nto their own land. There they will be ruled by a righteous king and\nbecome a light to the whole world, pointing all nations to the ways of\nthe Lord. God will help Israel find its place in the biblical drama.\n\nBible Project\n\nMicah Introduction\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Micah_BP', 'Micah_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\nAs of 10/2022 Spoken Gospel has no Micah introduction\n\nMicah Series\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

A Roman\ncenturion’s declaration near the end of the book - Surely this man was\nthe Son of God! - models the witness to Jesus this gospel calls for.\nThe opening half of this fast-moving drama keys on the question: Who\ndo you say I am? An episode at the end of the first half shows Jesus\nhealing a blind man in two stages, so that he slowly comes to see. In\nthe same way the disciples have only gradually come to recognize who\nJesus is. Then in a key moment in the story, between its two halves,\nPeter confesses that Jesus is the Messiah.\nNow the conflict moves out into the open. Jesus has come to introduce\na radical new way of life that will undercut existing power\nrelationships. The second half of the drama depicts this in three\nacts:\n\nJesus and his disciples travel to Jerusalem.\n\nJesus teaches in the temple and clashes with the\nestablished leadership.\n\nIn the final act, that leadership executes its plan and has\nJesus arrested and crucified, seemingly overturning all he has\ndone. But then God overturns their deed and raises Jesus to\nlife. So Mark’s readers are called to be faithful to Jesus, even in\nsuffering, because this is how God continues to overturn the\nexisting order and establish the way of life that Jesus taught.\n\n\n\nBible Project\n\nMark Introduction\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Mark_BP', 'Mark_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013-2014 Mark Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

Together\nthey tell the story of how God first invited the people of Israel, and\nthen all nations, to follow Jesus. In the first volume, the movement\nis toward Jerusalem, the center of Jewish national life. In the\nsecond, the movement is from Jerusalem to other nations, closing with\nPaul proclaiming the kingdom of God in Rome, the capital of the\nempire.\nLuke addresses his history to most excellent Theophilus,most likely a\nRoman official. His volumes are stocked with details from sources Luke\nhad available: letters, speeches, songs, travel accounts, trial\ntranscripts and biographical anecdotes. Luke’s purpose is to show the\nfulfillment of God’s plan to bring his light to the world through\nIsrael. The earliest Jesus-followers take up this calling by\nannouncing Jesus’ victory over sin and death to all the nations.\nThe first volume, Luke’s telling of the story of Jesus, has three main\nsections:\n\nJesus ministers in Galilee, the northern area of the land of\nIsrael.\n\nHe takes a long journey to Jerusalem, during which he welcomes\npeople into the way of God’s reign and challenges Israel’s current\nunderstanding of the kingdom.\n\nLuke tells how Jesus gives his life in Jerusalem and then rises\nfrom the dead to be revealed as Israel’s King and the world’s true\nLord.\n\n\n\nBible Project\n\nLuke Introduction\nPart 1: Luke 1-9 ...\nPart 2: Luke 10-24\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Luke_BP', 'Luke_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n2014-2015 Luke Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

Just as the first creation was completed in seven days,\nJohn uses the number seven to structure his book. For the Jews the\nnumber seven represented completeness and wholeness, a finished work\nof God revealing his purpose for the world.\nThe story is told in two main parts. The first describes Jesus’ public\nministry and has seven sections. Each section closes with a report on\nhow people respond to Jesus, either in faith or unbelief. The second\npart is devoted to the Passover weekend, when Jesus gave his life for\nthe world.\nJohn records seven instances in which Jesus revealed his identity by\nusing the phrase I am, the name by which God had revealed himself\nearlier. Similarly, John records seven miraculous signs that Jesus\nperformed. John’s narrative mentions twice that the resurrection of\nJesus took place on the first day of the week. In this way he confirms\nthat the power of a new creation has broken into our world.\n\nBible Project\n\nJohn Introduction\nPart 1: John 1-12 ...\nPart 2: John 13-21\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('John_BP', 'John_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n2015 John Series (Mid Week)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

God’s covenants with his human partners were\nimperfect, and humans failed to be faithful to the agreement. But\nJesus established a new covenant that is open to all people, Jew and\nGentile, creating a multiethnic family of God where self-giving love\nand forgiveness are at the center of everything.\nAt a Glance\n\nOverview\n2009 Romans Series\n2016 Romans Series\n2021 Romans Misc\n\nOverview\nNIV Bible Romans Introduction\n\nAddressing the believers in Rome, Paul writes what is most likely the\nmeatiest missionary fundraising letter ever written. To\nJesus-followers living directly under the shadow of Caesar, he is\nappealing for help to bring the gospel to the western part of the\nempire. As an apostle, Paul has been set apart to make the royal\nannouncement about the Lordship of Jesus. God’s plan for the world has\nbeen revealed through a descendant of king David—Jesus the\nMessiah. This message demonstrates that God has been faithful to his\ncovenant with Israel.\nThe flow of the letter follows the pattern of the ancient Jewish story\nof slavery and rescue. Humanity is in exile due to the entrance of sin\nand death into the world. Even the Jewish law could not defeat death\nand bring life. But God has come to rescue both Jews and Gentiles\nthrough the death and resurrection of Jesus. A new worldwide family is\nbeing created. Baptism into Jesus breaks the power of evil and brings\nfreedom. The Holy Spirit leads the way into this new life that will be\ncomplete in a new inheritance—a redeemed creation.\nAlthough many in Israel had failed to believe in the Messiah, this\nended up bringing life to the rest of the world. The offer of life\nthrough Jesus remains for all, however, and in the end God’s mercy\nwill triumph over judgment. The closing emphasis is on the practical\nshape of a redeemed humanity’s new way of life.\n\nBible Project\n\nRomans Introduction\nPart 1: Romans 1-4 ...\nPart 2: Romans 5-16\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Romans_BP', 'Romans_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n2009 Romans Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

He visited the city of\nCorinth there, a wealthy and cosmopolitan commercial center. Many\npeople became believers, so he stayed for a year and a half to teach\nthem.\nAfter he left, the Corinthians wrote to Paul (in a letter we no longer\nhave) with some key questions. The Corinthians had adopted the common\nGreek idea that physical things are bad, so they wanted to free the\nhuman spirit from the body. This affected the way they saw such things\nas marriage, attendance at ceremonial meals for pagan gods, and even\nthe resurrection of Jesus. In the letter we know as 1 Corinthians Paul\naddresses all of these concerns, as well as questions about worship.\nPaul writes that this world in its present form is passing away,but\nthe Corinthians can give themselves fully to the work of the Lord\nsince their labor in the Lord is not in vain. The coming resurrection\nof the dead, and the new world that will accompany it, will show the\nvalue of all their current efforts. Paul’s practical advice for how to\nconsistently embody the new life of God’s kingdom during a particular\nscene in the biblical drama gives us great insight as we seek to take\nup our roles today.\n\nBible Project\n\n1 Corinthians Introduction\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('1Corinthians_BP', '1Corinthians_BP.png', 75);\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n2009 1 Corinthians Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

Paul traveled here\non each of the three journeys he made to spread the message about\nJesus. The Galatians received both Paul and his gospel announcement\nwarmly. But later some people Paul calls agitators came and challenged\nPaul’s leadership as well as the foundation of his teaching. So Paul\nwrote to answer the threat to his status as an apostle and to reaffirm\nthe core message that faith in the Messiah is the basis of membership\nin God’s new community.\nPaul doesn’t open his letter by appealing to the apostles in\nJerusalem. Instead, he insists that the gospel I preached is not of\nhuman origin … rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus\nChrist.  Paul is compelled to share this revelation, and he notes that\nthe other apostles support him.\nPaul then proceeds to his main argument, which is that Gentiles who\nhave become followers of Jesus do not need to be circumcised. The new\nworldwide family which had been promised to Abraham is created by\nfaith in Messiah Jesus, not by keeping the Jewish law (Torah). The\nbiblical story had been pointing to this all along.\nBut if following Torah is not the basis of the gospel, won’t there be\nanarchy? Paul answers by describing what Spirit-empowered life looks\nlike in the community of Messiah-followers. Paul closes by emphasizing\nthe main theme of his letter once more: Neither circumcision nor\nuncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation.\n\nBible Project\n\nGalatians Introduction\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Galatians_BP', 'Galatians_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n2010 Galatians Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

Many people became believers,\nbut there was a riot when Paul and Silas were accused of defying\nCaesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus\n(see Acts 17:1-9). They narrowly escaped with their lives and had to\nflee.\nA little later Paul became concerned that the believers in\nThessalonica might fall away from the faith due to the opposition they\nwere facing. So he sent Timothy to encourage them (as a Greek he could\nmake the trip more safely). When Timothy returned to Achaia with the\nwelcome news that the Thessalonians had remained faithful, Paul wrote\nto express his joy.\nIn this short letter, Paul first recalls his time in Thessalonica and\ngives thanks for their continuing faith, despite trials and\nchallenges. He teaches them to avoid sexual immorality, to love one\nanother sincerely, and to work hard to earn their own living.\nPaul then addresses a key pastoral question: What is the Christian\nhope for those who have died? He explains that believers who die\nbefore the royal appearance of the Messiah are not lost, but will\nsurely be raised from the dead when he comes. He reminds the\nThessalonians that Jesus will appear suddenly and unexpectedly. They\nshould therefore live in such a way that they would be unashamed to\ngreet him. Throughout the letter Paul’s basic message is, “Keep up the\ngood work!”\n\nBible Project\n\n1 Thessalonians Introduction\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('1Thessalonians_BP', '1Thessalonians_BP.png', 75);\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\n  \n\n\n\n2010 1 Thessalonians Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\nNOTE: This series covers both First and Second Thessalonians\n\n\n\n\n\n  1.

The day of the\nLord was a phrase from the Hebrew prophets to describe God’s key\nvictory over every opponent, when his faithful ones would be\nrewarded. The Thessalonians’ concern seems to have been not that the\nday had come and gone and they had missed it, but that it was now\npresent. That would mean nothing more was to be expected from God in\nterms of setting things right. Since they continued to suffer\npersecutions, this was a depressing prospect.\nEven before he contradicts this false report, Paul reassures the\nThessalonians that God will indeed pay back all those who were\ntroubling them. He reminds them of the details he had discussed with\nthem in person of how the day of the Lord would arrive. He then\nrepeats some instruction from his earlier letter, urging them not to\nbe idle but to work hard and earn their own livings.\nAt the end of the letter, most of which would have been written by a\nscribe, Paul adds a greeting in his own handwriting.

While in exile on the island of Patmos, a Jewish Christian\nprophet named John received a vision showing that the cult of emperor\nworship would soon become deadly to followers of the Messiah. The book\nof Revelation (or Apocalypse, meaning unveiling) is a warning,\ncirculated to seven cities in the Roman province of Asia Minor. John’s\nmain point is to challenge and encourage the believers in the midst of\ntheir opposition and persecution.\nRevelation is an apocalypse, a literary form well known in John’s\nday. In an apocalypse a visitor from heaven reveals the secrets of the\nunseen world and the future through vivid symbols. While the symbols\nmay appear strange at first, they become more clear when seen in their\nfirst-century setting and in light of other Bible imagery.\nJohn’s vision has four main parts, each marked by the phrase in the\nSpirit. After words of warning and encouragement to each of the seven\nchurches, John’s visions then center on Jesus—his role in redemption\nand the judgments he brings to the world. The immoral political and\neconomic forces that rebel against God will be destroyed, and the\nMessiah will triumph over all his enemies. The vision closes with the\npromise that God’s faithful servants will reign over the new creation.\nRevelation also functions as the appropriate conclusion to the entire\ndrama of the Bible. John concludes with images from the garden of\nEden, the first story in the Bible. The world will experience a fresh\nbeginning: He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making\neverything new!”\n\nBible Project\n\nRevelation Introduction\nPart 1: Rev 1-11 ...\nPart 2: Rev 12-22\n\n\n  \n    \n    Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('Revelation_BP', 'Revelation_BP.png', 75);\n\n\n\n\nSpoken Gospel\n\nAs of 3/2022 Spoken Gospel has no Revelation introduction\n\n2011 Revelation Series (Sundays)\nCornerstone Chapel\n\n\n\n\n  1.

It begins\nwith Jesus sending his disciples ahead of him in a boat while he goes\nup a mountain to pray. During the night, a storm arises, and Jesus\ncomes toward them, walking on the water.\nMark 6:45-52:\nThis account is similar to the one in Matthew. It\ndescribes Jesus walking on the water and his disciples'\nreaction. Jesus gets into the boat with them, and the wind ceases.\nJohn 6:16-21:\nThis passage also tells the story of Jesus walking on\nwater after the feeding of the five thousand. The disciples get into a\nboat and Jesus joins them by walking on the sea.

Acts 10\nBonus Verse:\n\"All the prophets testify about him that through his name everyone who\nbelieves in him receives forgiveness of sins.\"\n... Acts 10:43\nCornerstone Teaching Acts 10\n\nCornelius\nwas a Gentile\nwas a Roman centurion\nwas devout and God-fearing\nhe gave generously\nhe prayed regularly\neven though he was devout, he still needed Jesus\n\n\nPeter and Simon\nPeter was staying at the home of a Jewish man named Simon, which\nwas very unusual because of his profession as a Jew.\nIt’s worth noting that as a tanner, Simon had to be in contact with dead\nanimals, which was strictly forbidden for godly Jews.\nSimon the tanner would have been considered unclean, and, therefore,\nhe had to live outside of town.\nPastor Gary said, “There are some things that we do because it’s simply\ntradition. … Tradition would have taught Peter [that he should never go\nnear much less into the house of an unclean person! Peter didn’t seem\nto be concerned with traditions that weren’t in the Scriptures.] There’s\na lot of traditions that we embrace, and we believe and that we think\nare right, and they may not be biblical. [Peter was] going to have his\nheart stretched [to] accept something or someone or a group of\npeople who up until this point, he would never have accepted.” \n\n\nPeter and Cornelius\nPeter rejected Cornelius’ “worshipful” greeting.\nPeter shared a simple message about the life, death, and resurrection of\nJesus.\nEveryone in Cornelius’ household heard, received, and believed the truth\nabout Jesus, and they were saved.\nThe Holy Spirit came in response to their faith in Jesus, and they were\nbaptized in the Spirit.\n\n\n\nMaps\n\n\n  \n    \n    BASE: Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('VBS_map1', 'VBS_map1.png', 75);\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    FIRST: Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('VBS_map2', 'VBS_map2.png', 75);\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    RECK: Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab\n  \n\n\n  addZoomableImage('VBS_map3', 'VBS_map3.png', 75);\n\n\n\n\n\n  // explicitly invoke our page setup here\n  // - believe this is executed after all DOM elms (above) are up-and-running)\n  // - was having difficulty with following:\n  //      window.addEventListener('load', pageSetup());\n  //      * it was in fact executed EACH time the page is loaded\n  //      * HOWEVER the 'onload' event fired ONLY ONCE (not in navigating to other page and back)\n  //        - this must have something to do with how GITBOOK does it's navigation\n  //          ... not really sure\n\n  // handles BOTH registerImgClickFullScreenHandlers() & initializeCompletedChecks()\n  pageSetup();\n\n"}}}
