# Romans

The book of Romans is a detailed explanation of the Gospel message
written by Paul to the church in Rome. 

Since the garden, humans have repeatedly chosen sin and rebellion over
living by God’s wisdom. God’s covenants with his human partners were
imperfect, and humans failed to be faithful to the agreement. But
Jesus established a new covenant that is open to all people, Jew and
Gentile, creating a multiethnic family of God where self-giving love
and forgiveness are at the center of everything.

Romans is one of the most famous, quoted, and dearly loved books in
the whole Bible. This may be because it contains some of the clearest
and strong statements of the Gospel we have in Scripture. But other
parts of Romans, and how it all fits together, can be difficult to
follow. That is because there is a story behind the book of Romans. It
is the story of the conflict which arose between Jews and Gentiles as
they began integrating in synagogues and house churches throughout
Rome, and how Jesus brings them together.

## Overview


**{{book.NivBible}} Romans Introduction**

> Addressing the believers in Rome, Paul writes what is most likely the
> meatiest missionary fundraising letter ever written. To
> Jesus-followers living directly under the shadow of Caesar, he is
> appealing for help to bring the gospel to the western part of the
> empire. As an apostle, Paul has been set apart to make the royal
> announcement about the Lordship of Jesus. God’s plan for the world has
> been revealed through a descendant of king David—Jesus the
> Messiah. This message demonstrates that God has been faithful to his
> covenant with Israel.
> 
> The flow of the letter follows the pattern of the ancient Jewish story
> of slavery and rescue. Humanity is in exile due to the entrance of sin
> and death into the world. Even the Jewish law could not defeat death
> and bring life. But God has come to rescue both Jews and Gentiles
> through the death and resurrection of Jesus. A new worldwide family is
> being created. Baptism into Jesus breaks the power of evil and brings
> freedom. The Holy Spirit leads the way into this new life that will be
> complete in a new inheritance—a redeemed creation.
> 
> Although many in Israel had failed to believe in the Messiah, this
> ended up bringing life to the rest of the world. The offer of life
> through Jesus remains for all, however, and in the end God’s mercy
> will triumph over judgment. The closing emphasis is on the practical
> shape of a redeemed humanity’s new way of life.
