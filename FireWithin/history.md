  v1.0 - Revelation <i>(Nov 15, 2020)</i>
</h3>
<br/>

**This is where it all began ... _my initial release_**

- Added {{book.Revelation}} to my Study Guide.

  Believe it or not, this is the first book I studied during the
  initial stages of my renewed faith.  It's not exactly where things
  begin, but it certainly is where the things of this world will end!
  
  The current state of our world made me realize that something was
  not right.  Everything seemed upside down.  This caused me to start
  thinking about end times _(prompted by my previous Church
  background, and the prodding of the Holy Spirit)_!
  
  If you had told me a few years ago, that I was interested in
  Revelation, I would have laughed :-) It is so symbolic and elusive.
  This is one topic where assistance is most appreciated _(from a
  trusted source)_.  Luckily Pastor Gary _(from
  {{book.CornerstoneChapel}})_ made this difficult book come alive
  ... <mark>try it you'll like it</mark>!
