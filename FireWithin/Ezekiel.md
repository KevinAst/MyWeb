# Ezekiel

The book of Ezekiel wrestles with the exile of God's people into
Assyria and the departure of God's presence from the
temple. Eventually, the temple will be destroyed, and it's Ezekiel's
job to explain why.

While the people of Israel were quick to assume God abandoned his
people and that their enemies overpowered him, they're wrong. Ezekiel
says both Israel's exile and the temple's destruction were God's
doing. God was punishing Israel for their sins. But Ezekiel also
prophecies about a future hope where God would return Israel to her
land, give her a new heart, and live with her forever.

The good news is that the hope that Ezekiel prophesied has come true
in Jesus!

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} Ezekiel Introduction**

> The priest Ezekiel was among the Judeans that Nebuchadnezzar brought
> to Babylon in 597 BC. Five years into this exile, God called Ezekiel
> to go to Israel (both those in Babylon and those back in Judea) and
> speak my words to them. Ezekiel often brought this message by composing
> finely polished poetic oracles and speaking (or perhaps singing) them
> in public. But he also told stories with symbolic meanings, performed
> symbolic actions, and described extraordinary visions that he had
> received.
> 
> The book of Ezekiel organizes these messages into three main parts:
> oracles of judgment against Israel, oracles against other nations, and
> then promises of Israel’s restoration. These divisions are marked by
> references to the prophet losing and then regaining his ability to
> speak. A key vision near the beginning describes how God removed his
> presence from the Jerusalem temple because of Israel’s evil. The
> oracles against the nations make it clear that though God’s temple was
> destroyed, no one should conclude that God is not still in control of
> the world. Those who threaten his people will be defeated in the
> end. The book’s closing promises confirm that God will renew the
> hearts of his people and refresh all life on the face of the
> earth. Ezekiel’s visions fit the ongoing drama of the Bible: a broken
> world will be healed when the Lord returns to live with his people in
> a land that has become like the garden of Eden.
