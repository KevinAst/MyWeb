# Getting Started

<script type="text/javascript" src="pageSetup.js"></script>

Overall the _**"Fire Within"**_ Bible Study Guide is simple to use.
It is, _at it's core_, simply a consolidated list of resource links to
help you in your Bible Study.  With that said, this section highlights
a number of things that you should know to get the most out of this
site.

## Basic Appearance

You can change the basic appearance of the site through the **Text
Menu**, found in the upper-left of the page.  You can change the
&bull; text size &bull; display font &bull; and color theme _(I prefer
the "Night" theme, giving you a dark mode)_.

       style="border:3px solid DarkRed;"
       src="start_appearanceControls.png"
       alt="Book Selection"
       width="350px">
</center>

## Going Home

The **Home** menu _(found in the upper-right of the page)_ will take
you back to the wiiBridges home page.

<center>
  <img class="diagram"
       style="border:3px solid DarkRed;"
       src="start_homeControl.png"
       alt="Book Selection"
       width="300px">
</center>

## Left Nav Bar

The books of the Bible are accessed through the **Left Nav** Bar.
They are found in the Old and New Testament sections, which are
themselves expandable.  By simply clicking the desired book, you will
will be taken to the study resources for that book.

<center>
  <img class="diagram"
       style="border:3px solid DarkRed;"
       src="start_leftNavBookSelection.png"
       alt="Book Selection"
       width="300px">
</center>

The **Left Nav** itself is expandable using the menu control, found in
the upper-left of the page.  This control is a toggle that will either
expand or contract the **Left Nav** Bar.

<center>
  <img class="diagram"
       style="border:3px solid DarkRed;"
       src="start_leftNavToggle.png"
       alt="Book Selection"
       width="500px">
</center>

> Please note that on a **desktop** the **Left Nav** will start out
> open, while on a smaller device _(such as a cell phone)_ it
> will start out closed.

## Work In Progress

You may have noticed that this site is a work-in-progress.  At the
time of this writing I have compiled only a small number of books in
the Bible.  These represent the books that I have, or am currently
studying _(since my renewed faith)_.  You are welcome to try one of
these existing studies ... **just click on the desired book (in the
Left Nav Bar)**.  I will be adding more as I continue my study.

> If there is a specific book you are wanting to study _(ahead of my
> schedule)_, I would be happy to compile those resources _(it takes
> me roughly 2 hours per book)_.  Please reach out to me and I will be
> glad to add an "early release" of that book :-) You can reach me at
> `kevin AT wiiBridges DOT com`
> or Direct Message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kevinast)

## Resource Links

As mentioned in the [Welcome Page](intro.md), this site is merely an
accumulation of resource links that guide me through the books of the
Bible.  Because they are concisely organized, it helps in keeping
track of where you are your study.

> A word about the resource links found in this site ... they will
> consistently take you to another tab in your browser.  This is done
> purposefully, so you won't loose your place in your study.  To get
> back to this page, simply re-select it in your browser tabs.

## Where Am I?

It can sometimes be hard to remember where you left off in your study
... especially when there are a large number of lessons in a series.
For that reason, you will find a "Completed Checkbox" for each lesson
of a Sermon Series.  By simply clicking the checkbox, it will be
remembered the next time you come back.

<center>
  <img class="diagram"
       style="border:3px solid DarkRed;"
       src="start_completedCheck.png"
       alt="click checkboxes to show completion"
       width="500px">
</center>

> Please understand that the "Complete Checkbox" state is held in your
> local device.  That means the status will not follow you when you
> use multiple devices _(say a laptop and a cell phone)_.  In other
> words, it's really the status of the device you are using.
> 
> This feature is merely meant to be a convenience, and was
> implemented using the simplest technique.

## Diagrams

In some cases, a presentation or sermon series will use a detailed
diagram to get their points across.  When this happens _(and I have
the time)_, I will extract that diagram and make it available as one
of the resources of this site.

These diagrams are typically fairly large, and may not be readable
when restricted by the browser window.  As a result, I have added the
following features:

- You can "hover over the diagram" with your mouse, and it will
  zoom/expand on that section.  On a cell phone you can "press and
  hold" your finger to get the same effect.

- You can also "click the diagram" to open it in a new tab of your
  browser.
  * from there you can re-orient the browser window so it is visible
    concurrently with the video presentation
  * you can also print the diagram by using your browser controls

> Try this out for yourself with the following sample _(taken from the
> [Revelation](Revelation.md) series)_:

<center>
  <figure>
    <div id="RevelationTimeline_CS2"></div>
    <figcaption>Hover to zoom, Click to open in new tab</figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>
<script>
  addZoomableImage('RevelationTimeline_CS2', 'RevelationTimeline_CS.png', 75);
</script>


## Responsive Design

This site will have a slightly different appearance, depending on
whether you use it on a desktop or a smaller device _(such as a cell
phone)_.

For example the Sermon Series will use a more concise vertical layout
on a cell phone _(where you have less screen real estate)_.

> Also Note that if you have the [You Version](https://www.bible.com/)
> Bible App installed on your phone, the scripture references will be
> serviced by the Bible App _(this is a nice feature indeed)_!
