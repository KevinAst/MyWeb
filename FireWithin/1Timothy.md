# 1 Timothy

After false teachers had disrupted the church Timothy was working
with, Paul gave Timothy encouragement and guidance for how to address
these teachers and lead the church effectively. Throughout the book,
we see that what a church believes will directly shape how its members
live and behave.

The church's theology and beliefs must constantly be critiqued and
formed by the Bible and the Gospel message. Churches should be known
for their devotion to the risen King Jesus and model integrity, good
works, and service to the poor and most vulnerable.

In 1 Timothy, we read about a holistic vision of the nature and
mission of the Church. Just as in Timothy's time, corrupt teachers can
confuse believers, but Paul instructs on how the Church and its
leaders can stay faithful to the way of Jesus.

## Overview

**{{book.NivBible}} 1 Timothy Introduction**

> After Paul was released from prison in Rome, he discovered that
> leaders in the Ephesian church had distorted the genuine message they
> had first heard from Paul himself. They had misapplied certain Jewish
> practices and borrowed some others from the philosophies of the
> day. They restricted certain foods, forbade marriage and stressed
> controversial speculations as the path to spiritual progress. At the
> same time, they tolerated immoral behavior. So Paul sent his co-worker
> Timothy to Ephesus and wrote him a letter, which he was expected to
> share with the church. He hoped it would give Timothy the power and
> influence to set things in order until Paul could get to Ephesus
> himself.
> 
> Paul’s focus is on what true leadership in the church looks like. This
> would help the Ephesians reject those who weren’t qualified and
> replace them with those who were. Paul includes a special warning
> toward the end of his letter about the dangers of greed, which seemed
> to be at the root of their problems.
> 
> Throughout the letter Paul uses the phrase Christ Jesus - that is,
> Messiah Jesus - which emphasizes the kingly rule of Jesus. This helped
> remind the church that Jesus is their real leader and is the clearest
> model of authentic leadership.
