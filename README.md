## Overview

This project contains the master source for my personal web page, used
to promote my open source projects.

## Internal Notes

The baseline style of this page was taken from [Bootstrap Templates]
... specifically [grayscale].  Other themes considered were [resume],
[creative], and [agency] (the latter from which the timeline was
gleaned ... see timeline entries in `MyPage/css/myStyle.css`).


The project file structure holds all web-page content in the `MyPage/`
directory.  This directory is published to gh-pages
(https://kevinast.github.io/MyWeb/), from which my various domains are
forwarded.

The [grayscale] run-time assets were pruned to include only needed
run-time references.  These assets can be found in the following
directories.

**run-time assets ... NOT project specific**:
```
MyPage/
  css/     ... also includes project resource: mystyle.css
  js/
  vendor/
    bootstrap/
    fontawesome-free/
    jquery/
    jquery-easing/
```

**Note**: an attempt was made to consolidate these items in an
`assets\` directory, but nixed due to some internal references
requiring this directory structure. **All other files are project
specific web page content!**


## Publish Web Content

To publish the content, simply:

```shell
$ npm run publish:web
```

**Notes:**
- This can be run **anytime** _(for patches)_ from **any branch** _(although typically master)_.
- For significant changes:
  - update change history _(below)_
  - PR to master branch
  - tag the release _(ex: **v1.1.0**)_
